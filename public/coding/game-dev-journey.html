This page is for anyone who wants to go on that journey with me, or who is just interested! I am learning how to use the free game engine <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot</a> to make a 2D game.</p><blockquote class="tip"><p><b><abbr title="Your Mileage May Vary">YMMV</abbr></b>: Keep in mind that I have some experiencing coding (especially JavaScript and Java). Though I do have to learn a new language for Godot (GDScript) it's a very easy language to learn.</p><p>Also, if you follow along don't feel pressured to do it as the same pace as me! I have a LOT of free time to do stuff like this, and only worked on it on free days (and not every free day!)</p></blockquote><div id="toc"></div></section><style>.elapsed-time{font-size:.9em;margin-top:1.5em;text-align:center}.elapsed-time b{letter-spacing:.05em}</style><section><h2 id="day1">Day 1 - G'day Godot</h2><h3 data-step="1">Deciding on a Game Engine</h3><p>On day 1 I knew I had to decide on a game engine before doing anything else. After researching a bit, I decided to use the free game engine <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot</a>. I chose it because it's supposed to be easy for beginners, can be used to create 2D as well as 3D games, and can export games for PC, Mobile Phones and the Web! It honestly almost seems to good to be true!</p><img src="https://godotengine.org/assets/press/logo_vertical_color_light.png" alt="Godot Game Engine Logo" width="200"><p>Another possible choice would have been Unity, which is the most famous game engine, but it uses C# and while I technically learned C# in school I don't remember anything... So that's a not from me.</p><h3 data-step="2">Downloading Godot</h3><p>I <a href="https://godotengine.org/download/windows/" target="_blank">downloaded Godot</a> (no installation necessary!) and then downlaoded and took the free <a href="https://www.gdquest.com/tutorial/godot/learning-paths/godot-tours-101/" target="_blank">Godot Tour</a> to get familiar with Godot's UI. This only took a few minutes and I already felt less overwhelmed after doing it! The step is optional but it's so quick that I do recommend it.</p><img src="https://gdquest.com/tutorial/godot/learning-paths/godot-tours-101/tour-101-screenshot-02.webp" alt="Godot Tour Screenshot" width="600"><br><p>This step is also when I started taking <b>notes</b>. Whenever I thought "Oh, I should remember that" I wrote it down.</p><h3 data-step="3">Learning GDScript Basics</h3><p>Now it was time to learn GDScript, Godot's coding language. I read through <a href="https://gdquest.github.io/learn-gdscript/" target="_blank">Learn GDScript From Zero</a>, which is a free interactive tutorial that covers the very basics of GDScript. Most of it was already familiar to me because I have experience coding, and GDScript is not much different than other programming langauges. However, I did learn some valuable Godot-specific things, especially in <b>lessons 7, 10, 11, 15, 21, 24, and 26</b>. I skipped most of the 'practice' parts because they weren't much of a challenge for me. If you're a total beginner to coding it's <i>not</i> optional though!</p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvMTM5OTc0MC84MTU4MzQ0LnBuZw==/original/JFxxIf.png" alt="GDScript Tutorial Screenshot" width="600"><p>All in all, going through the tutorial took me about an hour. I don't know everything, but I've got the basic syntax down, which is the basis I was looking for. I added some of the new stuff I learned to my notes, so that I wouldn't have to go through the tutorial again.</p><p class="elapsed-time">Total time elapsed on this day: <b>1.5 hours</b>. Total time elapsed since start: <b>1.5 hours</b></p></section><section><h2 id="day2">Day 2 - Plunging in</h2><h3 data-step="4">Setting Goals</h3><p>I knew I needed a way to keep track of the skills I have and the ones I still have to learn, so I decided to write a list of what I want to learn. I already had an idea for a simple first game that I kept in mind while writing the list. At the end, the list looked something like this:</p><details><summary>Show/Hide</summary><p><b>Things I want to know how to do:</b></p><ul><li>How to add text / button to the UI</li><li>How to add things to the UI programmatically</li><li>How to make things happen on click/hover</li><li>How to switch between scenes (e.g. Menus)</li><li>How to make game settings</li><li>How to make text appear on screen (as if typed out)</li><li>How to get user text input</li><li>How to make a pause menu</li><li>How to make things happen on keyboard input</li><li>How to make things happen on mouse movement</li><li>How to save game data / state</li><li>How to add sound effects</li><li>How to add background music</li><li>How to add volume sliders</li><li>How to animate things in the scene/UI</li><li>How to move around a character</li><li>How to make a character jump</li><li>How to make a character collect things</li><li>How to deal with screen resolution, window size, etc</li><li>How to export a game for Windows</li><li>How to test game performance</li><li>How to test the game in general</li><li>How to do version management</li><li>How to add Steam support (e.g. achievements)</li><li>How to do Input Remapping</li><li>How to export a game for Mobile</li><li>How to export a game for Web</li><li>How to get your game on itch.io or Steam</li></ul></details><br><p>I knew that I will have to expand this list later due to the <a href="https://agilecoffee.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/14-dunning-kruger.jpg" target="_blank">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>, but for now it looked good.</p><h3 data-step="5">Tutorial Time!</h3><p>Well, at this point I had procrastinated enough and it was time to actually start making a game. I looked around for a good video tutorial I could follow along with and found <a href="https://youtu.be/LOhfqjmasi0" target="_blank">How to make a Video Game - Godot Beginner Tutorial</a> by <i>Brackeys</i>, which seemed to be one of the most popular and best tutorials for Godot beginners. It was 10 months old when I watched it, and some things changed between the Godot version used in the tutorial and the current one I was using, but the comments were very helpful for dealing with these differences.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LOhfqjmasi0?si=In9-9EHx0aLj3Rsu" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen aria-label="YouTube video: Godot tutorial"></iframe><p>I watched the video and created the game alongside with it. I took my time, taking a break after every two chapters or so. I also made sure to take ample notes, so I wouldn't have to go back to the video as often and could just consult my notes instead.</p><p>The tutorial is only a bit over an hour long, but it probably took me about 2-3 hours to go through it once and create the game as shown in the tutorial. Weirdly, writing my own notes was what took the longest; creating the game really did not take that long.</p><p>The feeling of achievement when I had for the first time in my life created a playable game (well, more accurately, the start of the first level of a game) was great!</p><p class="elapsed-time">Total time elapsed on this day: <b>3 hours</b>. Total time elapsed since start: <b>4.5 hours</b></p></section><section><h2 id="day3">Day 3 - Here we go again</h2><h3 data-step="6">Doing it all over again</h3><p>I knew that having made the game once alongside with the tutorial wasn't enough, so I decided to do the <b>same</b> project <b>again</b> but this time <b>without</b> viewing the video again. This way, I tested how much information I had retained (and how good my notes were).</p><p>This honestly took longer than expected (about 2.5 hours), but at last I could fix all my bugs by comparing my project to the one I had created alongside with the tutorial. This way, I could learn from my mistakes instead of just watching the tutorial again!</p><p>I had the biggest issues with collisions and layers, especially for the enemy, so I noted down that I needed to look into collisions in detail later on. But honestly, for now I had enough of that stuff. Moving on!</p><h3 data-step="7">Tutorial Time - Theory!</h3><p>Having finished with Brackey's Godot beginner tutorial video, I moved on to the next recommended one: <a href="https://youtu.be/e1zJS31tr88" target="_blank">How to program in Godot - GDScript Tutorial</a>. This was a tutorial for complete coding beginners, so I was able to skip large parts of it, but I made sure to pay close attention to anything Godot-specific (Modifying nodes, Dicitionaries,Match, Signals), as well as the chapters on classes, inheritance and composition, because I was very rusty when it came to those topics.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e1zJS31tr88?si=obfJqdGs7C_A27Cg" aria-label="GDScript Tutorial Video" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Since this was just a theoretical video, I did not code anything alongside watching. I did take notes, though. The video is 1 hour long, and that's also roughly how long I spent on it.</p><p></p><p>I also watched another short video on inheritance/composition in Godot by Bitlytic: <a href="https://youtu.be/74y6zWZfQKk" target="_blank">How You Can Easily Make Your Code Simpler in Godot 4</a>. It was also mentioned in the long tutorial above, but I actually had already watched it at this point.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" aria-label="GDScript Tutorial Video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/74y6zWZfQKk?si=qpZLNzNaksXsstfd" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>It's only a few minutes long and explains an alternate to class inheritance.</p><p class="elapsed-time">Total time elapsed on this day: <b>3.5 hours</b>. Total time elapsed since start: <b>7.5 hours</b></p></section><section><h2 id="day4">Day 4 - My tiny project</h2><h3 data-step="8">Applying what I've learned</h3><p>I took such lovely notes on GDScript while watching the tutorial on it on day 3, so it was time to actually put the theory into practice!</p><p>I started a new, tiny project which only had a label and two buttons, and tried to use everything that was new to me, i.e. inputs, variable exports, random number generation, custom signals, the clamp functions, getters and setters, ...</p><p>I did this for about an hour.</p><p>It felt good to simply code for a while, because that's where I'm most comfortable. But then I tried to change the color of a button, and realised with horror that that opened up a whole new can of worms... Oh well:</p><h3 data-step="9">GUI is hard, apparently</h3><p>I took one quick look at Godot's documentation on GUI skinning and noped the hell out of there.</p><p>That's right, it was time for another video tutorial! And I found an <i>amazing</i> one: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_OFJLyqlXI" target="_blank">Godot UI Basics - how to build beautiful interfaces that work everywhere (Beginners)</a> by <i>Godotneers</i>. It's an hour long, which seemed unnecessarily long to me at first (oh, how naive I was!), but now I wish it was twice as long because it's such a good tutorial and covered lots of good stuff.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" aria-label="GUI YouTube Tutorial" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1_OFJLyqlXI?si=eMuj2d2rOof5taPh" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Again, I took some notes, and cleaned up all my notes in general (since I had so many at this point), which took about half an hour.</p><p class="elapsed-time">Total time elapsed on this day: <b>2.5 hours</b>. Total time elapsed since start: <b>10 hours</b></p></section><section><h2 id="day5">Day 5 - Making a menu</h2><h3 data-step="10">Trying my hand at a GUI</h3><p>Again, it was time to practice what I've learned in the video tutorial, so I tinkered around in my tiny project, attempting to make an okay-looking GUI. I made sure to try out everything the tutorial had taught me. I struggled a bit, but after about an hour I was somewhat satisfied.</p><p>The whole hour I had not written a single line of code - creating the GUI is really more a process of juggling around nodes and properties in Godot's own UI. This was a bit demotivating to me, but I already felt like I had a much better overview of it all than the day before, so I had made progress at least.</p><h3 data-step="11">Switching Scenes, Saving Settings</h3><p>One thing I knew I still had to learn was how to switch scenes, e.g. go from the Main Menu to a Settings Menu, or into the first level. This was not covered in any tutorial I've watched up until that point, so I had to find out for myself. Again, I expanded my tiny project to include a Settings scene just to try my hand at switching scenes.</p><p>I quickly realised I also had to learn how to make two scenes communicate with each other. When trying to find out how (by googling) I stumbled upon the common pattern of using an Autoload script for settings.</p><p>The next logical step was to learn how to save these settings in a file, so that they'd be saved for the next time playing. This was much easier than expected using <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.3/classes/class_configfile.html" target="_blank">ConfigFile</a>.</p><p>In total, I played around for about an hour, and my 'game' felt much more like a game now that is had a settings screen and actually saved these settings! I also had fun again because I was working with code again finally!</p><p class="elapsed-time">Total time elapsed on this day: <b>2 hours</b>. Total time elapsed since start: <b>12 hours</b></p></section><section><h2 id="day6">Day 6 - A lazy day</h2><h3 data-step="12">Watching tutorials in bed</h3><p>I'mma be honest, I really wasn't motivated to open up Godot and actually make something on that day, so I decided to at least watch a long-ish video that I have to watch at some point anyway.</p><p>I came across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8gYHTjDCic" target="_blank">Godot Components - how to structure a game into manageable parts (Beginner/Intermediate)</a> by <i>Godotneers</i>, and since I also really liked the other tutorial my <i>Godotneers</i> it was unsurprising that this one was really good as well! It covers a lot (and I mean a lot: it's over an hour long!) of basic project structuring and component communication tips, and he explains it with the help of an actual project, so it was easy to understand the real-world application of the theoretical topics.</p><p>Generally, it might seem a bit murky to you what this tutorial is really about, but I 100% recommend watching it! (And don't be turned off by the AI-generated art in the thumbnail...)</p><iframe width="560" height="315" aria-label="Component Tutorial" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W8gYHTjDCic?si=LYvP_fV3RSXTxaQQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>I also took ample notes again.</p><p class="elapsed-time">Total time elapsed on this day: <b>1.5 hours</b>. Total time elapsed since start: <b>13.5 hours</b></p></section><section><h2 id="day7">Day 7 - Finishing up the basics</h2><h3 data-step="13">Theory, Theory, Theory</h3><p>I found another great basic tutorial and decided to watch that as well before closing off the first week and finally starting my first real project!</p><p>The video is <a href="https://youtu.be/4vAkTHeoORk?si=An1f0Jx5MRume1ch" target="_blank">Data models - using data to create extensible, maintainable games in Godot</a> by <i>Godotneers</i> (again). It mostly taught me about resources in Godot - an important part that I had been missing so far.
