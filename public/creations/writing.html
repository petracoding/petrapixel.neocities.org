          <h1>My Writing</h1>
          <p>
            I grew up blessed with a librarian mom, so I always loved to read and therefore also to write. I obviously started writing in my native language (German) but started writing in English as
            soon as I could (age 14) and never went back to German! I sometimes write original fiction, but mostly I write fanfictions. <img aria-hidden="true" src="../img/inline/blush.gif" /> I am
            planning my first novel, a love story about a trouple in the late 70s! I have published one short horror story in an online literary magazine, but I can't link to it here because it is
            credited to my full name, which I don't want y'all strangers to know!
          </p>

          <h2>My Favorite Things about Writing</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>literally creating a world that doesn't exist <span class="gend-link"></span></li>
            <li>when the characters just start doing stuff on their own <span class="gend-link"></span></li>
            <li>"whoops i just wrote x thousand words" <span class="gend-link"></span></li>
            <li>using language to describe abstract concepts <span class="gend-link"></span></li>
            <li>witty dialogue that makes my friends go "haha" <span class="gend-link"></span></li>
            <li>wonderful comments from readers <span class="gend-link"></span></li>
            <li>boasting about the word count <span class="gend-link"></span></li>
            <li>using a new word i just learned <span class="gend-link"></span></li>
          </ul>
          <hr />
          <h2>Word Count</h2>
          <p>
            I used to have this stupid goal of writing at least 5,000 words per month. I don't always manage. <img aria-hidden="true" src="../img/inline/dead.gif" /> Here's how much I wrote in the
            past year!

          <h2>Comments</h2>
          <p>I'd like to think that I'm not bad at writing. But don't take my word for it, read these lovely comments I've gotten on my fanfictions:</p>
          <ul class="writing-comments">
            <li>
              10/10!!!! I REPEAT, 10/10!!!!! This was amazing!!!! I LOVED every bit of it!!!! Thank you so much!!!!! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I just.... Everyone was so spot on and its just
              amazing. If you go back and look at any given sentence or paragraph just assume I was having the time of my life reading every bit of it!!!! <span class="gend-link"></span>
            </li>
            <li>BHDHDBANAKF THIS FIC IS ACTUALLY SO GOOD it is going to be living in my head rent free forever omg <span class="gend-link"></span></li>
            <li>But I’m not ready for it to be over :((( <span class="gend-link"></span></li>
            <li>
              [...] I need this ! It's so great written and I literally have like the most personal connection to ‍░░░░░ 's character because I'm also polyamours and this is how I felt when I like two
              of my online friends also... I don't know how to say this, but stories like this make me so happy- because people work hard on writing things that hopefully make them happy :)! Also this
              is such a good written romance book, because it doesn't just show all the love and romance stuff but it actually shows how someone that is questioning their sexuality in two different
              ways... are gonna have ups and downs towards it :] Hope you like my very much NOT/MAYBE/VERY? needed love towards your wonderful story :) Yours truly beloved reader, ‍░░░░░ [...] :)
              thank you for writing such a lovely story and I can't wait to read more ... <span class="gend-link"></span>
            </li>
            <li>
              I LOVE your characterisations, they seem very real and nuanced. The friendship, the way they communicate, the foundation of trust are all chefs kiss. <span class="gend-link"></span>
            </li>
            <li>
              OMG idk if you're still checking comments on this so late but this was BEAUTIFUL from start to finish! I downloaded it to read in the car while I was driving home, and it was such a ride
              and just all the soft feelings and all the soft moments <span class="gend-link"></span>
            </li>
            <li>Read this to my gf, she's literally crying tears of joy rn. <span class="gend-link"></span></li>
            <li>Should I have started this at 2 am? Probably not. Is it now 3:45 and I have no regrets? Yes <span class="gend-link"></span></li>
            <li>
              This has moved its way to the top of my favorite ‍░░░░░ fics and I plan on revisiting it many, many times as there is so much goodness here to get lost it. There is so much I want to
              comment on (line by line, honestly) but I will say for now that you have really mastered "them"---their voices, their mannerisms [...]. It felt wildly "in character" for lack of a better
              phrase. <span class="gend-link"></span>
            </li>
            <li>THIS LINE RIGHT HERE YOUR HONOUR IS WHAT BROKE ME <span class="gend-link"></span></li>
            <li>
              WHAT?!?! That’s the ending???? Noooooooooooooooooooo!!!!! I’m so sad! This story was incredible and awesome and AMAZING!!! I never wanted it to end!!! You did such a good job!
              AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! <span class="gend-link"></span>
            </li>
            <li>
              Okay, this may sound weird, but talking about how you realize that you realize you love someone’s masculinity just as much as you love their femininity feels like such a queer/bisexual
              experience. I was sitting there like "omg. That’s so true. I think about women’s feminine features the way ‍░░░░░ is thinking about ‍░░░░░’ masculine features. That’s wild." Just know
              that your writing makes people reflect on their own relationship with their sexuality in such a positive way. That is incredible skill, and it shows how thoughtful you are as a writer.
              Applause. In fact, several rounds of applause. <span class="gend-link"></span>
            </li>
            <li>This is insanity-inducing in the best way &lt;3 write moooooore ░░░░░ fic I'm desperate</li>
            <li>I could hear their voices and see it so perfectly 🥹</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Make sure to tell the author of your next fave fanfic that they're amazing - - it really does make all the difference!</p>
