  <h2>Compressing Images</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Download and install the free software
      <a href="https://saerasoft.com/caesium/" target="_blank">Caesium</a>.
      (They also have an
      <a href="https://caesium.app/" target="_blank">online image compressor</a>
      by the way, but we won't be using this.)
    </li>
    <li>
      Open Caesium and click the settings icon to open your preferences. There,
      make sure "Import files in subfolders when opening a directory" is
      checked.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the files/folders you want to compress (e.g. your "Photos" folder) by
      using the green buttons.
    </li>
    <li>
      Change the compression settings (on the right side) to whatever you like.
      The Default quality settings are absolutely fine.
    </li>
    <li>
      In the "Output" settings, make sure to check the following settings so
      that the compressed images automatically replace the original ones:

      <ul>
        <li>Same folder as input</li>
        <li>Keep folder structure</li>
        <li>Skip if output size is bigger than the original</li>
        <li>Keep file dates</li>
      </ul>
      <img
        src="../assets/img/etc/caesium.png"
        alt="A screenshot of the software."
      />
    </li>
    <li>
      Click the "Compress" button and wait. This might take a few minutes or
      even hours, depending on how many files you're compressing.
    </li>
    <li>Done! It will now show you how much space you've saved.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Compressing Videos</h2>
  <p>
    If you have many or large video files it can save a lot of space to compress
    these too. We need a different program for that.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Download and install the free software
      <a href="https://handbrake.fr/" target="_blank">HandBrake</a>.
    </li>
    <li>Open HandBrake and select your video files / folders.</li>
    <li>
      Open the settings by clicking "Tools" in the menu and selecting
      "Preferences". Here, switch to the "Output Files" tab and change the
      following settings:
      <ul>
        <li>Automatically name output files: yes</li>
        <li>Default Path: <code>{source_path}/compressed</code></li>
        <li>File Format: <code>{source}</code></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Close the preferences window.</li>
    <li>
      For the rendering settings, select these:
      <ul>
        <li>(Summary tab:) <b>Format: MP4</b></li>
        <li>
          (Video tab:) <b>Video Encoder: H.26<u>5</u></b> (NOT H.26<u>4</u>!)
        </li>
        <li>Leave everything else as-is.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      You can save these settings as a new present, name it "Save file size" or
      something like that. Make sure it's the selected preset.
    </li>
    <li>
      Click the little arrow next to the "Add to Queue" button and select "Add
      All" to add all your selected videos to the rendering queue.
    </li>
    <li>
      Start the rendering process by clicking the "Start Encode" button. You can
      view progress details if you click the "Queue" button to view the queue.
    </li>
    <li>
      Now wait! It'll take a while, maybe several hours, depending on how many
      videos you are rendering and how large they are. If you want to, you can
      select something to do "When Done", this way you can make your PC
      automatically shutdown when the rendering is finished.
    </li>
  </ol>
