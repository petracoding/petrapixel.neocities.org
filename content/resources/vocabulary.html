  <h1>Vocabulary <img aria-hidden="true" src="../assets/img/inline/star.gif" /></h1>
  <p>
    <b>I love learning new English words.</b> I'm an english student, writer, and <b>not</b> a native speaker. Knowing more words gives me the freedom to better express myself, and to understand the
    world better! <img aria-hidden="true" src="../assets/img/inline/happy.gif" />
  </p>
  <p>
    Sometimes I study vocabulary about a specific topic, e.g. clothing, pirates, and the judicial system. But most of the time I just study those that I have come across while reading and watching
    TV/movies; I always write down words that I don't know or am not sure of. <img aria-hidden="true" src="../assets/img/inline/yes.gif" /> (I've collected over 2,000 words over the last few years!)
  </p>
  <p>
    To study vocabulary I use <a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/">vocabulary.com</a>, a wonderful site that makes it very easy to create vocab lists (you can paste entire e-books into it and it will
    pick out the difficult words!), and it's fun to study the lists! I also love the way they give definitions, because the descriptions are funny and memorable. This is starting to sound like an ad,
    so I'll stop. <a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/profiles/A01LYN0RH04WMH">Here's my profile.</a> I have 1,685,045 points at the time of writing and have learned over 1,000 words (and surely
    forgotten at least half of them...).
  </p>
  <p>
    To revise vocabulary I have studied before I usually export the words from vocabulary.com (<a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/470272-vocabulary-com-export">using my own userscript</a>) and
    import them into <a href="https://quizlet.com/">Quizlet</a>, which is a flashcard site/app that I also love using for studying for Uni. I also coded a little
    <a href="https://petracoding.github.io/vocabulary-manager.html" target="_blank">vocabulary manager tool</a> to help with sorting and filtering my vocabulary lists.
  </p>
  <!--
  <p>
    When organizing my vocabulary lists I usually use 3 tools:
    <s
      >One is <a href="https://www.helperset.com/tools/remove-duplicates-from-list">this site</a>, which removes duplicates from your list. Another is
      <a href="https://sortmylist.com/">this site</a> which can sort lists alphabetically.</s
    >
    I have now made myself my own <a href="https://petracoding.github.io/vocabulary-manager.html" target="_blank">vocabulary manager</a> for all the tasks listed above. And lastly, I use
    vocabulary.com, as mentioned, because with it you can sort your vocabulary lists by difficulty of word, which is pretty awesome! (If you want more helpful links like this you can check out my
    <a href="/resources/bookmarks.html">bookmarks page</a>.)
