  <h1>Petra's 2nd Indie Web Contest!</h1>

  <p>My last indie web contest was a celebration for me reaching 300 followers on Neocities. As I now have more than 1300 followers I think it's time for another one!</p>

  <p>I see so many beautiful, interesting, unique, and helpful websites on the indie web, and the point of this contest to celebrate them!</p>

  <h2>Rules</h2>
  <br />

  <u>Participation Rules:</u>

  <ul class="list-with-more-spacingX">
    <li>
      <b>Your website should be coded by you.</b>
      <ul>
        <li>No social media profiles, carrds, etc.</li>
        <li>No AI-generated code or main page content. (The odd AI-generated image is ok.)</li>
        <li>
          <b>No out-of-the-box layouts/templates are allowed</b> (including mine). However, layouts based on template generators or similar tools are allowed as long as you've added your own touch to
          them by changing the appearance enough. This means they shouldn't look like the default output of the layout generator you used. Basically, if I can tell which generator you used, it's
          probably not allowed.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Your website should not be empty or under heavy construction.</b> This means you should have at least 2 subpages with content. Homepages with no working links in the navigation do not count
      as finished. Please remove any links that don't work yet from your navigation.
    </li>
    <li>Your website can be <b>hosted anywhere</b>; it does not have to be hosted on Neocities.</li>
    <li>
      If you have a concrete follower count of your website (e.g. on Neocities or Nekoweb) please only participate if you have <b>fewer than 300 followers</b> at the time of participating. (It's fine
      if you go over the limit while the contest is ongoing.) Similarly, if you don't have a concrete follower count but know that you have a very popular site, please do not participate, as the point
      of this contest is to give "unknown gems" a chance to shine!
    </li>
    <li>No hate content or discrimination of any kind. If I see such content on your site you will be disqualified.</li>
    <li>No corporate websites, CVs, etc. This contest is for indie websites.</li>
    <li>NSFW/18+ is okay, but please check the NSFW/18+ checkbox in the participation form.</li>
    <!--<li>Thanks for reading the rules! The password for the <a href="https://forms.gle/tghiskDFJmCruMdr9" target="_blank">participation form</a> is <i>cat</i>.</li>-->
    <li><b>Please also participate in the voting later!</b> The contest won't work if there are not enough voters!</li>
    <!-- <li>
        Thanks for reading the rules! To participate, use <a href="https://forms.gle/X7pzKXZ3hKfgyitB8" target="_blank">the participation form</a>. (Note: I won't look at your website before the end
        of January, so you can already participate now even if you're not done with your site yet as long as you finish before February!)
      </li> -->
    <!-- <li>Don't vote for yourself.</li> -->
  </ul>
  <p>If you're not sure about any of the rules just shoot me a message or comment below.</p>

  <details>
    <summary>Voting Rules</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>Only vote <b>ONCE</b>! (If you forgot whether you have already voted you can ask me in the comment section below.)</li>
      <li>
        While voting, think about the following: <b>creativity, aesthetics, usability, accessibility, responsiveness, content</b>, and (if you can) code quality. Do NOT just vote for the prettiest
        website! Content matters!!!
      </li>
      <li>You don't have to have participated to vote.</li>
      <li>
        If you've also participated you can give yourself any amount of points that you think you deserve. But don't try to cheat the system by giving everyone else 0 points; votes like these will not
        be counted!
      </li>
      <li>Don't award "friendship points" or give someone fewer points because you disagree with their views.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Evaluation</h2>

  <p>Before voting opens I will explain here how evaluation will work. It will probably be based on average points. (I can't do it with total points because not every voter rates every website.)</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>Prizes</h2>

  <p>
    There are no <i>physical</i> prizes, but your website will be <b>featured on this page</b> in perpetuity once the winners are decided, and you can feel really proud of yourself! Every winner will
    get a little <b>winner badge</b> for their website (in the form of a 88x31 button and a larger image). As a bonus, every winner can <b>request</b> any kind of tutorial/resource from me (though I
    obviously can't promise that I will be able to do it, but I will try).
  </p>
  <!-- <p>If you're <b>interested in offering a prize</b> - no matter how small or silly - please contact me through the comment section below or my guestbook, we'll make it happen!</p> -->
