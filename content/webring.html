  <h3>Rules</h3>
  <ul class="list-with-more-spacing">
    <li>
      <b>Your website should have at least some kind of resources for other webmasters</b>, such as coding tutorials, scripts, templates/layouts, tools, link lists (bookmarks), graphic collections
      (should be of a certain size; e.g. not just 10)... <b>Just linking to other people's resources doesn't count</b>, you need to have created something yourself.
    </li>
    <li>Your website should be coded by you. (No social media profiles, carrds, corporate websites, AI-generated sites, etc)</li>
    <li>Your website should be (at least mostly) finished. This means you should have at least 2 subpages with content. Homepages with no working links in the navigation do not count as finished.</li>
    <li>Your website can be hosted anywhere; it does not have to be hosted on Neocities.</li>
    <li>Your website may not have hate content or discrimination of any kind. Homophobes, transphobes, racists, sexists etc are not welcome.</li>
    <li>This is not a hard rule, but please make an effort to make your website responsive and accessible.</li>
    <li>Please add the widget to your website <b>before</b> filling out the form!</li>
    <li>Please contact me (via my guestbook, profile or the form below) if your site's URL changes, you want to leave the webring, or any other update is necessary.</li>
    <li>Thanks for reading the rules! Please use <a href="https://forms.gle/st3g8xobQnLKDwndA" target="_blank">this form</a> to join!</li>
