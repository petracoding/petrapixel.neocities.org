  <h1>Petra's 1st Indie Web Contest!</h1>
  <p><b>As a celebration for reaching 300 followers on Neocities, I wanted to make an indie web contest!</b></p>
  <p>
    I see so many beautiful, interesting, unique, and helpful websites on the indie web, and I had the idea of celebrating the more unknown ones by creating a contest! I'm sure I'm not the first one
    to do this, I don't claim this as an original idea... I just thought it would be fun!

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>The results are in! Some stats:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>There were a total of <b>65</b> participants, though 1 was disqualified due to having an unfinished website.</li>
    <li><b>72</b> people participated in the voting, though 2 of those responses were deleted due to obvious cheating (= giving one site the maximum points and every other site 0 points).</li>
    <li>
      Voters could give each website <b>0-3 points</b>. The site with the highest average of points was <a href="https://abyssbloom.neocities.org/" target="_blank">Abyss Bloom</a> with
      <b>2.043</b> average points! (Note: Winners were calculated using an average point system instead of a total point system so that websites that were 18+ or contained triggering material and
      therefore were not rated as often were not disadvantaged!)
    </li>
    <li>For my own choices, I gave a maximum of <b>15</b> points. My winners all got <b>11</b> points from me!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Congratulations to all 6 winners!! And thanks to everyone else for participating as well!</p>
  <p><b>Note to all winners:</b> You should have received an email or guestbook comment with your prize. Let me know if you didn't!</p>

  <h2>Rules</h2>
  <br />
  <details>
    <summary>Participation Rules</summary>

    <ul class="list-with-more-spacingX">
      <li>
        <b>Your website should be coded by you.</b>
        <ul>
          <li>No social media profiles, carrds, etc.</li>
          <li>No AI-generated code or main page content. (The odd AI-generated image is ok.)</li>
          <li>
            <b>No out-of-the-box layouts/templates are allowed.</b> However, layouts based on template generators or similar tools are allowed as long as you've added your own touch to them by
            changing the code. This means they shouldn't look like the default output of the layout generator you used.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Your website should not be empty or under heavy construction.</b> This means you should have at least 2 subpages with content. Homepages with no working links in the navigation do not count
        as finished. Please remove any links that don't work yet from your navigation.
      </li>
      <li>Your website can be <b>hosted anywhere</b>; it does not have to be hosted on Neocities.</li>
      <li>
        If you have a concrete follower count of your website (e.g. on Neocities or Nekoweb) please only participate if you have <b>fewer than 150 followers</b> at the time of participating. (It's
        fine if you go over the limit while the contest is ongoing.) Similarly, if you don't have a concrete follower count but know that you have a very popular site, please do not participate, as
        the point of this contest is to give "unknown gems" a chance to shine!
      </li>
      <li>No hate content or discrimination of any kind. If I see such content on your site you will be disqualified.</li>
      <li>No corporate websites, CVs, etc. This contest is for indie websites.</li>
      <li>NSFW is okay, but please check the NSFW checkbox in the participation form.</li>
      <li><b>Please</b> participate in the voting in February!</li>
      <!-- <li>
        Thanks for reading the rules! To participate, use <a href="https://forms.gle/X7pzKXZ3hKfgyitB8" target="_blank">the participation form</a>. (Note: I won't look at your website before the end
        of January, so you can already participate now even if you're not done with your site yet as long as you finish before February!)
      </li> -->
      <!-- <li>Don't vote for yourself.</li> -->
    </ul>
    <p>If you're not sure about any of the rules just shoot me a message or just participate anyway - I will check each website.</p>
  </details>

  <br />
  <details>
    <summary>Voting Rules</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>Only vote <b>ONCE</b>! (If you forgot whether you have already voted you can ask me in the comment section below.)</li>
      <li>
        While voting, think about the following: <b>creativity, aesthetics, usability, accessibility, responsiveness, content</b>, and (if you can) code quality. Do NOT just vote for the prettiest
        website! Content matters!!!
      </li>
      <li>Please rate every website that you can. If for some reason you can't (e.g. because of trigger warnings) please select "no rating".</li>
      <li>You don't have to have participated to vote.</li>
      <li>You can give yourself any amount of points that you think you deserve, just don't try to cheat the system by giving everyone else 0 points.</li>
      <li>Don't award "friendship points" or give someone fewer points because you disagree with their views.</li>

  <h2>Evaluation</h2>

  <p></p>

  <p>
    There will be 3 winners
    <!-- (or 5 winners if there are more than 100 participants) -->
    in each of the two categories.
    <!-- There is no ranking inside the winners, so there is no 1st, 2nd... -->
  </p>

  <p>The categories are:</p>

  <ul class="list-with-more-spacing">
    <li>
      <b>Voter's choice:</b> Everyone rates the participating websites, giving them points according to what they think about them. The websites with the most points win. (I will add the link to the
      voting form to this page as soon as voting opens!)
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Petra's choice:</b> I decide which ones I like best. :D I will decide by rating your website on a scale of 0-5 concerning
      <b>content, visuals/aesthetic, responsiveness, accessibility, code quality</b> (I will look at your source code). The ones with the highest sum of points are the winners.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    A website can only win in one of the categories, not both. This means I won't choose the winners of voter's choice for my own category. (But I might mention it if you would have been my pick, so
    you know!)
  </p>
  <hr />

  <h2>Prizes</h2>

  <p>
    There are no <i>physical</i> prizes, but your website will be <b>featured on this page</b> in perpetuity once the winners are decided, and you can feel really proud of yourself! Every winner will
    get a little <b>winner badge</b> for their website (in the form of a 88x31 button and a larger image). As a bonus, every winner can <b>request</b> any kind of tutorial/resource from me (though I
    obviously can't promise that I will be able to do it, but I will try).
  </p>
  <!-- <p>If you're <b>interested in offering a prize</b> - no matter how small or silly - please contact me through the comment section below or my guestbook, we'll make it happen!</p> -->
