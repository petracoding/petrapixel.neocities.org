  <h1>Google Sheets API Tutorial</h1>
  <i class="fa-brands fa-google-drive"></i>
  <p>This tutorial will teach you how to read data from a <a href="https://workspace.google.com/products/sheets/" target="_blank">Google Sheets</a> document with JavaScript.</p>
  <p><b>Intermediate JavaScript knowledge is required.</b></p>
  <p>Want to see it in action? I used the Google Sheets API to create my <a href="/coding/cliques">list of web cliques</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="key">1. Creating the API key</h2>
  <p>
    To read data from a Google Sheets document, we will need to use the Google Sheets <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>. To do this, we need an <b>API key</b>, which is like a
    password that we need to use so that we're allowed to use the API. Thankfully, the Google Sheets API is free.
  </p>
  <p>The API key will look something like this: <code>AIazSyAkeZN1nT_waVBWKMbDy0F68lxe-fRKbOo</code></p>
  <p>Here's how to create a key:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>While logged into your Google Account, go to the <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Cloud Console</a>.</li>
    <li>There, create a new project for your website. Pick any Project Name, and for the 'Location' keep the default selection.</li>
    <li>
      Once you've created the project you can use the menu (open it by pressing the menu button in the top left corner) to navigate to "APIs and services", then to "Credentials". (Or just use
      <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials" target="_blank">this link</a>)
    </li>
    <li>On the "Credentials" page, click the "Create credentials" button on the top and select "API key". You can now copy this key for later. (The name of the API key does not matter.)</li>
  </ol>
  <br />
  <div class="images">
    <img class="image" src="../assets/img/coding/google-api-tutorial/gc1.png" alt="A screenshot showing project creation" />
    <img class="image" src="../assets/img/coding/google-api-tutorial/gc2.png" alt="A screenshot showing API key creation" />
  </div>
  <hr />
  <p>Now, after saving your API should already work. However:</p>
  <blockquote class="warning">
    <p>
      Anyone who knows the key will be able to use it. Since we will be using the key in a JavaScript file,
      <b>anyone who inspects the code of your website will be able to view your key and therefore use it</b>! If you think nobody will do that, you don't have to do anything. Since we will only be
      using the key to READ data and not WRITE data, it's really not that terrible if someone does use your key. But if you want to prevent it anyways, you will need to do the following steps:
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Edit your key by pressing the button on the right and selecting "Edit API key"</li>
    <li>Under <b>Application restrictions</b>, choose "Websites".</li>
    <li>Now there should be a (still empty) list of websites that are allowed to use the API key. Press the "Add" button to add a website.</li>
    <li>
      For the live version of your website, add something like this: <code>https://petrapixel.neocities.org/*</code> (Make sure you have the <code>*</code> at the end, otherwise it will only work on
      your home page.)
    </li>
    <li>If you also edit your website on localhost, you also need to add <code>http://localhost:8080/*</code> (change the port to whatever port you use).</li>
    <li>Under <b>API restrictions</b>, choose "Restrict key" and select the "Google Sheets API" only. This means that your key can only be used for this API and no other Google API.</li>
  </ol>

  <br />
  <div class="images">
    <img class="image" src="../assets/img/coding/google-api-tutorial/gc3.png" alt="A screenshot showing API key website restrictions" />
    <img class="image" src="../assets/img/coding/google-api-tutorial/gc4.png" alt="A screenshot showing API key API restrictions" />
  </div>

  <p>Now <b>save</b>. As it says there, it might take a few minutes before the changes take effect.</p>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      <b>If you have a public GitHub repository for your website:</b> For further protection of you API key, you could use
      <a href="https://medium.com/@oadaramola/a-pitfall-i-almost-fell-into-d1d3461b2fb8" target="_blank">Environment variables (.env file)</a>. However, keep in mind that at the end of the day, your
      API key will still be publically visible for anyone inspecting the JavaScript code of your website, so you can't really fully hide it. For this reason, I won't be covering how to use environment
      variables in this tutorial.
    </p>

  <h2 id="sheets">2. Creating the data</h2>
  <p>
    You can now create a Google Sheets document with any data imaginable. For example, a table of movies you've seen: Each row is a movie, and you have the columns "Movie name", "Year", "Rating", etc.
  </p>
  <p>Now, publish your file to be read-only for anyone who has the link. (<b>Your Google Sheets Document -> Share -> General access -> Anyone with the link: Viewer</b>)</p>
  <div class="images">
    <img class="image" src="../assets/img/coding/google-api-tutorial/gs1.png" alt="A screenshot showing the 'Share' button" />
    <img class="image" src="../assets/img/coding/google-api-tutorial/gs2.png" alt="A screenshot showing the 'Share' popup" />
  </div>

  <h3>Optional: Google Forms</h3>
  <p>
    You can create a <a href="https://workspace.google.com/products/forms/" target="_blank">Google Form</a> and link it to a Google Sheets document (Your Google Form -> Responses -> Link to Sheets).
    That way, new responses will be automatically added to the Google Sheets document, and the changes are instantly live on your website.
  </p>
  <p>You will still need to publish your Google Sheets document if you do this. (Share -> General access -> Anyone with the link: Viewer)</p>
  <p>Tip: You can receive an email whenever someone submits a response to the form. (Your Google Form -> Responses -> Menu -> Get email notifications for new responses)</p>
  <div class="images">
    <img class="image" src="../assets/img/coding/google-api-tutorial/gf1.png" alt="A screenshot showing the 'Link to Sheets' option" />
    <img class="image" src="../assets/img/coding/google-api-tutorial/gf2.png" alt="A screenshot showing email notification option" />
  </div>
  <blockquote class="warning">
    <p>
      If you do this, people will be able to add data to your website by filling out the form - <b>without</b> you having moderated the responses first! Therefore, make sure you have proper
      <b>response validation</b> in place (Your Google Form -> Your Question -> Menu (Button on bottom right) -> Response Validation) (I recommend at least a maximum length) and check your data in the
      JS code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, <b>do not</b> use <code>.innerHTML =</code> to display data on your website if you display data inputted by users, otherwise they will be able to inject HTML code and potentially change
      the appearance and content of the entire page!
      <a href="https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/html-injection/" target="_blank">Read more about malicious code injection here.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      I would also recommend not displaying images submitted by users, as this would make it easy for trolls to display bad things on your website. Instead, you can accept images in your form, but
      read from a different (manually created) column in your JS. That way, you can check submitted images, and if they're okay you can add them to the manually created column. For example, I have an
      "Image" column that is automatically filled with user input, and a "Image to Show" column that I fill myself, which is then read in my JS and displayed on my site.
    </p>

  <h2 id="api">3. Reading the data</h2>
  <p>
    We will be using the <a href="https://developers.google.com/workspace/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/spreadsheets.values/get" target="_blank">spreadsheets.values.get</a> method of the Google Sheets
    API to read our data in JavaScript.
  </p>
  <p>For this, we need 3 values:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The <b>Google Sheets API key</b> we have created, looks like this: <code>AIazSyAkeZN1nT_waVBWKMbDy0F68lxe-fRKbOo</code></li>
    <li>
      The <b>ID of the Google Sheet document</b>. You can get this from the URL of the spreadsheet, after "/spreadsheets/d" and before "/edit?...", e.g. in
      <i>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NhbWY2j-D2IMuOh2y7jP8wPL4oik8b-riaWOTxFD7Oc/edit?gid=1893245691</i> the ID is <code>1NhbWY2j-D2IMuOh2y7jP8wPL4oik8b-riaWOTxFD7Oc</code> (see screenshot
      below)
    </li>
    <li>The <b>name of the sheet</b> inside our document that we want to read, by default it is <code>Sheet1</code> or - for form responses - <code>Form responses 1</code></li>
  </ol>
  <br />
  <img class="image" src="../assets/img/coding/google-api-tutorial/url.png" alt="A screenshot of the spreadsheet ID in the URL" />
  <hr />
  <p>Here is the function we will be using:</p>
  <pre><code>async function fetchGoogleSheetData() {
  try {
    const apiKey = "YOUR_KEY_HERE";
    const spreadsheetId = "SPREADSHEET_ID_HERE";
    const sheetName = "Sheet1";
    const response = await fetch(`https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/${spreadsheetId}/values/${sheetName}?key=${apiKey}`);
    const data = await response.json();
    const rows = data.values;
    // do something with rows, e.g. rows.forEach(row => ...)
    console.log(rows);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching Google Sheets data:", error);
  }
}</code></pre>
  <p>Make sure to fill out the 3 values (API Key, Spreadsheet ID, Sheet name).</p>
  <p>
    Once you call the function (<code>fetchGoogleSheetData();</code>) you should already see your data (as an array of arrays) in the console! Every array element represents one row, and each element
    is again an array, with each element in that array representing the content of each column.
  </p>
  <p>Examples: <code>data.values[0][0]</code> is the content of cell A1. <code>data.values[1][2]</code> is the content of cell B3.</p>
  <img class="image" src="../assets/img/coding/google-api-tutorial/data.png" alt="A screenshot of the data in the console" />
  <p>Once this works, you can do whatever you want to display the data on your website. In the next section of this tutorial, I will show you how to display the data in a simple table.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="processing">4. Processing the data</h2>
  <p>(This step is optional.)</p>
  <p>I highly recommend processing your data before displaying it. For example, filter it, sort it, remove duplicates, etc.</p>
  <p>I won't go into detail here because it's not specific to the Google Sheets API - you just use Array functions.</p>
  <p>Here is an exaample of processing data:</p>
  <pre><code>function processData(data) {
  return (
    data
      // only get first 100 rows:
      .slice(0, 100)
      // only keep rows in which column 1 and 2 are not empty:
      .filter((d) => d[0] && d[1])
      // sort alphabetically by the text in column 2:
      .sort(function (a, b) {
        return a[1] && b[1] ? a[1].localeCompare(b[1]) : 0;
      })
  );
}</code></pre>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="display">5. Displaying the data</h2>
  <p>If you have table headings, you might want to split your data into two variables like so:</p>
  <pre><code>const tableHeadings = rows[0];
const tableData = rows.slice(1);</code></pre>
  <p>Here is a function that displays the data in a simple HTML table. I won't explain this code in detail as I think it should be self-explanatory at this point.</p>
  {% raw %}
  <pre><code>function constructTableFromData(wrapperEl, tableHeadings, tableData) {
  if (!wrapperEl) {
    console.error("Wrapper element for Google Sheets data table not found.");
    return;
  }
  if (!tableData || !tableHeadings) {
    console.error("Data for Google Sheets data table not found.");
    return;
  }

  const tableEl = document.createElement("table");
  const tableHead = document.createElement("thead");
  const tableBody = document.createElement("tbody");

  // Table Headers
  const row = document.createElement("tr");
  tableHeadings.forEach((cell) => {
    const cellElement = document.createElement("th");
    cellElement.textContent = cell; // do NOT use .innerHTML if displaying unmoderated content
    row.appendChild(cellElement);
  });
  tableHead.appendChild(row);

  // Table Rows
  for (let i = 0; i &lt; tableData.length; i++) {
    const row = document.createElement("tr");
    tableData[i].forEach((cell) => {
      const cellElement = document.createElement("td");
      cellElement.textContent = cell;
      row.appendChild(cellElement); // do NOT use .innerHTML if displaying unmoderated content
    });
    tableBody.appendChild(row);
  }

  tableEl.appendChild(tableHead);
  tableEl.appendChild(tableBody);
  wrapperEl.appendChild(tableEl);
}</code></pre>
  {% endraw %}

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <b>Tip:</b> If you want to display a loading gif while the data is being loaded, do this: In your wrapper element, add a loading gif. Then, at the very end of the code above, simply hide it (e.g.
    <code>document.querySelector("#loadingGif").style.display = "none";</code>)! Boom - easy as cake.
  </blockquote>

  <p>And that's it! Of course you don't need to display your data in a table - your imagination is the limit here!</p>
