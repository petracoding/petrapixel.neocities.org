  <h2 id="key">1. Creating the API key</h2>
  <p>
    To read data from a Google Sheets document, we will need to use the Google
    Sheets <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>. To do
    this, we need an <b>API key</b>, which is like a password that we need to
    use so that we're allowed to use the API. Thankfully, the Google Sheets API
    is free.
  </p>
  <p>
    The API key will look something like this:
    <code>AIazSyAkeZN1nT_waVBWKMbDy0F68lxe-fRKbOo</code>
  </p>
  <p>Here's how to create a key:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Make sure you're using MFA (2-Step Verification) for your Google account.
    </li>
    <li>
      While logged into your Google account, go to the
      <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/" target="_blank"
        >Google Cloud Console</a
      >.
    </li>
    <li>
      There, create a new project for your website. Pick any Project Name, and
      for the 'Location' keep the default selection.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once you've created the project you can use the menu (open it by pressing
      the menu button in the top left corner) to navigate to "APIs and
      services", then to "Credentials". (Or just use
      <a
        href="https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials"
        target="_blank"
        >this link</a
      >)
    </li>
    <li>
      On the "Credentials" page, click the "Create credentials" button on the
      top and select "API key". You can now copy this key for later. (The name
      of the API key does not matter.)
    </li>
  </ol>
  <br />
  <div class="images">
    <img
      class="image"
      src="../assets/img/coding/google-api-tutorial/gc1.png"
      alt="A screenshot showing project creation"
    />
    <img
      class="image"
      src="../assets/img/coding/google-api-tutorial/gc2.png"
      alt="A screenshot showing API key creation"
    />
  </div>
  <hr />
  <p>Now, after saving your API should already work. However:</p>
  <blockquote class="warning">
    <p>
      Anyone who knows the key will be able to use it. Since we will be using
      the key in a JavaScript file,
      <b
        >anyone who inspects the code of your website will be able to view your
        key and therefore use it</b
      >! If you think nobody will do that, you don't have to do anything. Since
      we will only be using the key to READ data and not WRITE data, it's really
      not that terrible if someone does use your key. But if you want to prevent
      it anyways, you will need to do the following steps:
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Edit your key by pressing the button on the right and selecting "Edit API
      key"
    </li>
    <li>Under <b>Application restrictions</b>, choose "Websites".</li>
    <li>
      Now there should be a (still empty) list of websites that are allowed to
      use the API key. Press the "Add" button to add a website.
    </li>
    <li>
      For the live version of your website, add something like this:
      <code>https://petrapixel.neocities.org/*</code> (Make sure you have the
      <code>*</code> at the end, otherwise it will only work on your home page.)
    </li>
    <li>
      If you also edit your website on localhost, you also need to add
      <code>http://localhost:8080/*</code> (change the port to whatever port you
      use).
    </li>
    <li>
      Under <b>API restrictions</b>, choose "Restrict key" and select the
      "Google Sheets API" only. This means that your key can only be used for
      this API and no other Google API.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <br />

  </div>

  <p>
    Now <b>save</b>. As it says there, it might take a few minutes before the
    changes take effect.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      <b>If you have a public GitHub repository for your website:</b> For
      further protection of you API key, you could use

        target="_blank"
        >Environment variables (.env file)</a
      >. However, keep in mind that at the end of the day, your API key will
      still be publically visible for anyone inspecting the JavaScript code of
      your website, so you can't really fully hide it. For this reason, I won't
      be covering how to use environment variables in this tutorial.

  <h2 id="sheets">2. Creating the data</h2>
  <p>
    You can now create a Google Sheets document with any data imaginable. For
    example, a table of movies you've seen: Each row is a movie, and you have
    the columns "Movie name", "Year", "Rating", etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, publish your file to be read-only for anyone who has the link. (<b
      >Your Google Sheets Document -> Share -> General access -> Anyone with the
      link: Viewer</b
    >)
  </p>
  <div class="images">
    <img
      class="image"
      src="../assets/img/coding/google-api-tutorial/gs1.png"
      alt="A screenshot showing the 'Share' button"
    />
    <img
      class="image"
      src="../assets/img/coding/google-api-tutorial/gs2.png"
      alt="A screenshot showing the 'Share' popup"
    />
  </div>

  <h3>Optional: Google Forms</h3>
  <p>
    You can create a
    <a href="https://workspace.google.com/products/forms/" target="_blank"
      >Google Form</a
    >
    and link it to a Google Sheets document (Your Google Form -> Responses ->
    Link to Sheets). That way, new responses will be automatically added to the
    Google Sheets document, and the changes are instantly live on your website.
  </p>
  <p>
    You will still need to publish your Google Sheets document if you do this.
    (Share -> General access -> Anyone with the link: Viewer)
  </p>
  <p>
    Tip: You can receive an email whenever someone submits a response to the
    form. (Your Google Form -> Responses -> Menu -> Get email notifications for
    new responses)
  </p>
  <div class="images">
    <img
      class="image"
      src="../assets/img/coding/google-api-tutorial/gf1.png"
      alt="A screenshot showing the 'Link to Sheets' option"
    />
    <img
      class="image"
      src="../assets/img/coding/google-api-tutorial/gf2.png"
      alt="A screenshot showing email notification option"
    />
  </div>
  <blockquote class="warning">
    <p>
      If you do this, people will be able to add data to your website by filling
      out the form - <b>without</b> you having moderated the responses first!
      Therefore, make sure you have proper <b>response validation</b> in place
      (Your Google Form -> Your Question -> Menu (Button on bottom right) ->
      Response Validation) (I recommend at least a maximum length) and check
      your data in the JS code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, <b>do not</b> use <code>.innerHTML =</code> to display data on your
      website if you display data inputted by users, otherwise they will be able
      to inject HTML code and potentially change the appearance and content of
      the entire page!
      <a
        href="https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/html-injection/"
        target="_blank"
        >Read more about malicious code injection here.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      I would also recommend not displaying images submitted by users, as this
      would make it easy for trolls to display bad things on your website.
      Instead, you can accept images in your form, but read from a different
      (manually created) column in your JS. That way, you can check submitted
      images, and if they're okay you can add them to the manually created
      column. For example, I have an "Image" column that is automatically filled
      with user input, and a "Image to Show" column that I fill myself, which is
      then read in my JS and displayed on my site.

  <h2 id="api">3. Reading the data</h2>
  <p>
    We will be using the
    <a
      href="https://developers.google.com/workspace/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/spreadsheets.values/get"
      target="_blank"
      >spreadsheets.values.get</a
    >
    method of the Google Sheets API to read our data in JavaScript.
  </p>
  <p>For this, we need 3 values:</p>
  <ol class="list-with-more-spacing">
    <li>
      The <b>Google Sheets API key</b> we have created, looks like this:
      <code>AIazSyAkeZN1nT_waVBWKMbDy0F68lxe-fRKbOo</code>
    </li>
    <li>
      The <b>ID of the Google Sheet document</b>. You can get this from the URL
      of the spreadsheet, after "/spreadsheets/d/" and before "/edit?...", e.g.
      in
      <i
        >https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NhbWY2j-D2IMuOh2y7jP8wPL4oik8b-riaWOTxFD7Oc/edit?gid=1893245691</i
      >
      the ID is <code>1NhbWY2j-D2IMuOh2y7jP8wPL4oik8b-riaWOTxFD7Oc</code> <br />
      <img
        class="image"
        src="../assets/img/coding/google-api-tutorial/url.png"
        alt="A screenshot of the spreadsheet ID in the URL"
      />
    </li>
    <li>
      The <b>name of the sheet</b> inside our document that we want to read, by
      default it is <code>Sheet1</code> or <code>Form responses 1</code> <br />
      <img
        class="image"
        src="../assets/img/coding/google-api-tutorial/sheetname.png"
        alt="A screenshot of the sheet name"
      />
      <br /><b>Look out: </b>If you're using Google in a different language, the
      default name of the sheet is different!
    </li>
  </ol>
  <br />

  <hr />
  <p>Here is the function we will be using:</p>
  <pre><code>async function fetchGoogleSheetData() {
  try {
    const apiKey = "YOUR_KEY_HERE";
    const spreadsheetId = "SPREADSHEET_ID_HERE";
    const sheetName = "Sheet1"; // or "Form responses 1", or default name in other language
    const response = await fetch(`https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/${spreadsheetId}/values/${sheetName}?key=${apiKey}`);
    const data = await response.json();
    const rows = data.values;
    // do something with rows, e.g. rows.forEach(row => ...)
    console.log(rows);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching Google Sheets data:", error);
  }
}</code></pre>
  <p>
    Make sure to fill out the 3 values (API Key, Spreadsheet ID, Sheet name).
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you call the function (<code>fetchGoogleSheetData();</code>) you should
    already see your data (as an array of arrays) in the console! Every array
    element represents one row, and each element is again an array, with each
    element in that array representing the content of each column.
  </p>
  <p>
    Examples: <code>data.values[0][0]</code> is the content of cell A1.
    <code>data.values[1][2]</code> is the content of cell B3.
  </p>
  <img
    class="image"
    src="../assets/img/coding/google-api-tutorial/data.png"
    alt="A screenshot of the data in the console"
  />
  <p>
    Once this works, you can do whatever you want to display the data on your
    website. In the next section of this tutorial, I will show you how to
    display the data in a simple table.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="processing">4. Processing the data</h2>
  <p>(This step is optional.)</p>
  <p>
    I highly recommend processing your data before displaying it. For example,
    filter it, sort it, remove duplicates, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    I won't go into detail here because it's not specific to the Google Sheets
    API - you just use Array functions.
  </p>
  <p>Here is an exaample of processing data:</p>
  <pre><code>function processData(data) {
  return (
    data
      // only get first 100 rows:
      .slice(0, 100)
      // only keep rows in which column 1 and 2 are not empty:
      .filter((d) => d[0] && d[1])
      // sort alphabetically by the text in column 2:
      .sort(function (a, b) {
        return a[1] && b[1] ? a[1].localeCompare(b[1]) : 0;
      })
  );
}</code></pre>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="display">5. Displaying the data</h2>
  <p>
    If you have table headings, you might want to split your data into two
    variables like so:
  </p>
  <pre><code>const tableHeadings = rows[0];
const tableData = rows.slice(1);</code></pre>
  <p>
    Here is a function that displays the data in a simple HTML table. I won't
    explain this code in detail as I think it should be self-explanatory at this
    point.
  </p>
  {% raw %}
  <pre><code>function constructTableFromData(wrapperEl, tableHeadings, tableData) {
  if (!wrapperEl) {
    console.error("Wrapper element for Google Sheets data table not found.");
    return;
  }
  if (!tableData || !tableHeadings) {
    console.error("Data for Google Sheets data table not found.");
    return;
  }

  const tableEl = document.createElement("table");
  const tableHead = document.createElement("thead");
  const tableBody = document.createElement("tbody");

  // Table Headers
  const row = document.createElement("tr");
  tableHeadings.forEach((cell) => {
    const cellElement = document.createElement("th");
    cellElement.textContent = cell; // do NOT use .innerHTML if displaying unmoderated content
    row.appendChild(cellElement);
  });
  tableHead.appendChild(row);

  // Table Rows
  for (let i = 0; i &lt; tableData.length; i++) {
    const row = document.createElement("tr");
    tableData[i].forEach((cell) => {
      const cellElement = document.createElement("td");
      cellElement.textContent = cell; // do NOT use .innerHTML if displaying unmoderated content
      row.appendChild(cellElement);
    });
    tableBody.appendChild(row);
  }

  tableEl.appendChild(tableHead);
  tableEl.appendChild(tableBody);
  wrapperEl.appendChild(tableEl);
}</code></pre>
  {% endraw %}

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <b>Tip:</b> If you want to display a loading gif while the data is being
    loaded, do this: In your wrapper element, add your graphic, e.g. a gif of a
    spinning circle. Then, at the very end of the code above, simply hide it
    (e.g.
    <code>document.querySelector("#loadingGif").style.display = "none";</code>)!
    Boom - easy as cake.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    And that's it! Of course you don't need to display your data in a table -
    your imagination is the limit here!
