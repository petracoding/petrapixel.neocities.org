  <h1>Cachebusting</h1>
  <i class="fa-solid fa-bomb"></i>
  <p>If your website doesn't update after you've made changes (aka you or your visitors see an old version of your website), it's probably because of cache.</p>
  <p>
    <b>Cache</b> is the data about a website that your browser saves to reduce loading time the next time you open a website. It's generally a good thing, but can get annoying when editing a website,
    because your browser will sometimes load an outdated version of your website. The same will happen to your website's visitors that visited it before. New visitors will always see the newest
    version, as they do not have your site cached yet.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this tutorial I will tell you how to empty your cache (as a temporary solution) and then how to prevent the browser from loading the cached files in the first place (as a permanent solution).
  </p>
  <p>Check the table below to choose a permanent cachebusting solution that works best for you!</p>

  <h2 id="howto">How to empty your cache</h2>
  <p>
    You can force your browser to load the current version instead of a cached version by <b>clearing your browser's cache</b>. However, you don't need to clear your entire browser's cache (that would
    log you out everywhere, super annoying), only the cache for your website specifically.
  </p>
  <p>Please note, if your website is a subdomain of your hoster (e.g. mywebsite.neocities.org), you'll be logged out of the hoster (e.g. Neocities) when you clear your cache!</p>
  <br />
  <details>

<section>
  <h2 id="query-string-versioning">Manual Query String Versioning</h2>
  <p>Let's learn how to prevent your website from being cached!</p>
  <p>Simply add <code>?nocache=1</code> to wherever you load your CSS and JS files, and increase the number every time you make a change:</p>
  <pre><code>&lt;link href="./style.css<b>?nocache=2</b>" rel="stylesheet" /&gt;
&lt;script src="./layout.js<b>?nocache=2</b>"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
  <p>
    Instead of always increasing the number you could also use the current date and time (e.g. <code>202502191425</code>), the number really doesn't matter as long as it's different each time and
    you've never used it before.
  </p>
  <blockquote class="tip">
    <b>Why it works: </b>We're tricking the browser into thinking that the filename (and therefore file) changed, which will make it load the most up-to-date version.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote class="success">
    <b>Done!</b> As long as you update the number every time you change your CSS/JS, you and your visitors don't need to empty your site's cache anymore to view the newest CSS and JavaScript changes.
  </blockquote>
  <p>Doing this manually is simple, but annoying. Read on to learn how to automate the process.</p>
</section>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<section>
  <h2 id="automated">Automated Query String Versioning</h2>
  <p>You can automate the method described above. Here's how.</p>

  <details>
    <summary>Read this if you're using a Static Site Generator (e.g. Eleventy)</summary>
    <p>Disregard the guide below. Instead, you can simply use your static site generator to add a unique number (e.g. timestamp) to your file paths for us.</p>
    <p>How this is done depends on the static site generator you are using.</p>
    <p>If you're using <b>Eleventy</b> (11ty): I described an easy way of automating cachebusting <a href="/coding/eleventy-tutorial#cachebusting">in my Eleventy tutorial</a>.</p>
  </details>
  <p>We will be using JavaScript to load a new version of the files automatically.</p>

  <h3 data-step="1">CSS Fallback</h3>
  <p><b>Load your CSS file like you would usually do</b> to ensure that users that have JavaScript disabled can still see your styling.</p>
  <p>
    <b>Do <u>not</u> load your JavaScript file as you usually would.</b> It will be loaded with the script below.
  </p>
  <pre><code>&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;style.css&quot; /&gt;
&lt;!-- NO! &lt;script src=&quot;script.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; --&gt;</code></pre>

  <h3 data-step="2">Add script on every page</h3>
  <p><b>Additionally,</b> in <u>every one</u> of your page files (<code>.html</code> files), add this code somewhere in between <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/head&gt;</code>:</p>
  <blockquote class="warning">You need to adjust the 2 variables! (See code comments)</blockquote>
  <pre><code>&lt;!-- CACHEBUSTING. https://petrapixel.neocities.org/coding/cachebusting --&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {

    // Path to your CSS file (like usual), or empty (&quot;&quot;) if you don&#39;t have one:
    const CSS_FILE_PATH = &quot;style.css&quot;; 
    
    // Path to your JS file (like usual), or empty (&quot;&quot;) if you don&#39;t have one:
    const JS_FILE_PATH = &quot;script.js&quot;; 
    
    function loadScript(src) {
      const script = document.createElement(&quot;script&quot;);
      script.src = src + &quot;?nocache=&quot; + new Date().getTime();
      script.async = true;
      document.head.appendChild(script);
    }
    function loadCSS(href) {
      const link = document.createElement(&quot;link&quot;);
      link.rel = &quot;stylesheet&quot;;
      link.href = href + &quot;?nocache=&quot; + new Date().getTime();
      document.head.appendChild(link);
    }
    if (JS_FILE_PATH) loadScript(JS_FILE_PATH);
    if (CSS_FILE_PATH) loadCSS(CSS_FILE_PATH);
});
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <b>Why it works: </b>This code loads your JS and CSS files with a unique number at the end. Like I explained earlier, this tricks the browser into thinking it's a new file, and therefore it will
    be freshly loaded. The number is calculated from the current date and time; this way it will never again be the same.
  </blockquote>

  <h3 data-step="3">JavaScript Adjustment</h3>
  <blockquote class="warning">If you skip this step your JavaScript might not execute <i>at all</i>!</blockquote>
  <p>
    Remove any <code>document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded")</code> you have in your own JavaScript file / code. Obviously don't remove it from the script you just copied -- That's the only spot
    where it's allowed to be.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Explanation</b>: Because of the script above, the JavaScript is now only added after the DOM is loaded, which means the "DOMContentLoaded" event has already fired. Anything that waits for this
    event will therefore never be executed.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p><b>Example</b>: You have to turn this...</p>
  <pre><code>document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", { 
    console.log("Hello World");
    // your code here...
});</code></pre>
  <p>into this...:</p>
  <pre><code>console.log("Hello World");
// your code here...</code></pre>

  <br />
  <p>
    If your main JavaScript code is only sometimes loaded with the code above but not always (e.g. if you only want to use the cachebusting solution on some but not all of your pages) you can do
    something like this to catch both possibilities:
  </p>
  <pre><code>if (document.readyState === "loading") {
  document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
    init();
  });
} else {
  init();
}

function init() {
  console.log("Hello World");
  // your code here...
}</code></pre>

  <h3 data-step="4">Testing</h3>
  <p>Test your pages to see if your CSS and JavaScript are loaded correctly.</p>
  <blockquote class="success">If everything still works you're done! You and your visitors don't need to empty your site's cache anymore to view the newest CSS and Javascript changes.</blockquote>

  <h2 id="service-worker">Using a Service Worker</h2>
  <p>This tutorial is still work in progress!</p>
</section>

<section style="display: none">
  <p>
    Query String Versioning (as described above) works fine for CSS and JavaScript files, but not for HTML files, images, or any other types of files. Therefore, I recommend using a service worker for
    cachebusting. Here's how it works.
  </p>

  <h3 data-step="1">CSS Fallback</h3>
  <p><b>Load your CSS file like you would usually do</b> to ensure that users that have JavaScript disabled can still see your styling.</p>

  <h3 data-step="2">Add script on every page</h3>

  <p><b>Additionally, </b>in <u>every one</u> of your page files (<code>.html</code> files), add this code somewhere in between <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/head&gt;</code>:</p>
  <blockquote class="warning">You need to adjust the 3 variables! (See code comments.)</blockquote>
  <pre><code>&lt;!-- CACHEBUSTING. https://petrapixel.neocities.org/coding/cachebusting --&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
  // THIS VARIABLE NEEDS TO BE CHANGED ACCORDING TO THE DEPTH OF THE FILE YOU&#39;RE PASTING THIS IN:
  // This file is in the root folder: &quot;./&quot;   in 1 subfolder: &quot;../&quot;   in 2 subfolders: &quot;../../&quot;   etc.
  const CACHEBUSTING_NESTING = &quot;./&quot;;

  // Name of your CSS file, or empty (&quot;&quot;) if you don&#39;t have one:
  // If your CSS file is in a folder include the folder name but not ../, e.g. CSS_FILENAME = "css/styling.css"
  const CSS_FILENAME = &quot;style.css&quot;; 

  // Name of your JS file, or empty (&quot;&quot;) if you don&#39;t have one:
  // If your JS file is in a folder include the folder name but not ../, e.g. JS_FILENAME = "assets/javascript/myScript.js"
  const JS_FILENAME = &quot;script.js&quot;; 

  function loadScript(src) {
    const script = document.createElement(&quot;script&quot;);
    script.src = src + &quot;?nocache=&quot; + new Date().getTime();
    script.async = true;
    document.head.appendChild(script);
  }
  function loadCSS(href) {
    const link = document.createElement(&quot;link&quot;);
    link.rel = &quot;stylesheet&quot;;

    document.head.appendChild(link);
  }
  function useQueryStringVersioning() {
    console.log(&quot;Executing classic cachebusting&quot;);
    if (JS_FILENAME) loadScript(CACHEBUSTING_NESTING + JS_FILENAME);
    if (CSS_FILENAME) loadCSS(CACHEBUSTING_NESTING + CSS_FILENAME);
  }
  if (&quot;serviceWorker&quot; in navigator) {  
    if (JS_FILENAME) loadScript(CACHEBUSTING_NESTING + JS_FILENAME);
    navigator.serviceWorker
      .register(CACHEBUSTING_NESTING + "service-worker.js")
      .then(() =&gt; console.log(&quot;Service Worker successfully registered&quot;))
      .catch(() =&gt; useQueryStringVersioning());
  } else {
    useQueryStringVersioning();
  }
});
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <b>What it does:</b> This code first checks if the browser supports the service worker functionality. (All modern browsers do, but if your visitor uses e.g. Internet Explorer, there won't be
    support.) If there is support, the JS is laoded and the service worker is started. Otherwise, it will fall back to automated query string versioning as I described earlier.
  </blockquote>

  <h3 data-step="3">JavaScript Adjustment</h3>
  <blockquote class="warning">If you skip this step your JavaScript might not execute <i>at all</i>!</blockquote>
  <p>
    Remove any <code>document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded")</code> you have in your own JavaScript file / code. Obviously don't remove it from the script you just copied -- That's the only spot

  <p>into this...:</p>
  <pre><code>console.log("Hello World");
// your code here...</code></pre>

  <h3 data-step="4">Service Worker file</h3>
  <p>Now, in your website's root folder (the uppermost folder; the one your homepage is in) create a file called <code>service-worker.js</code> and paste this content in:</p>

  <pre><code class="language-javascript">// CACHEBUSTING. https://petrapixel.neocities.org/coding/cachebusting
// This file needs to be placed in your website's root folder (the one your homepage is in), NOT a subfolder!

  self.skipWaiting();
});

self.addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {
  event.respondWith(fetch(event.request, { cache: "no-store" }));
});

self.addEventListener("activate", (event) => {
  event.waitUntil(
	caches.keys().then((cacheNames) => {
	  return Promise.all(cacheNames.map((cache) => caches.delete(cache)));
	})
  );
});</code></pre>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    <b>What it does:</b> This will set the cache rule for every request (e.g. for a CSS, JavaScript or image file) to "no-store", as well as disable caching for itself.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote class="warning">This file <b>must</b> be placed in the root folder, otherwise it will not work! This is because this file's position determines the code's scope.</blockquote>

  <h3 data-step="5">Testing</h3>
  <p>Let's test if your cachebusting is working instead of having blind faith that everything works.</p>
  <p>
    Open your browser's development tools (F12) and navigate to their "Application" tab. There, make sure "Service Workers" is selected. You should see <code>service-worker.js</code> with the status
    "Running".
  </p>
  <img src="../assets/img/coding/service-worker-running.png" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; border: 1px dotted" />
  <p>Additionally, in the "Console" tab you should see the message <code>Service Worker successfully registered</code>.</p>
  <p>If you're using an old browser to test you might see this message instead: <code>Executing classic cachebusting</code>. As long as you see either of these messages, it's fine!</p>
  <p>
    Also test if your JavaScript is executing as expected. If it doesn't, it probably isn't being loaded. In the development tools tab "Network", search for the name of your JavaScript file. It should
    be in the list. If it isn't, something's wrong.
  </p>
  <p>Test on all your pages, or at least a random sample of them, to confirm you've added the script correctly to every page.</p>

  <blockquote class="success">
    <p><b>Done!</b> You and your visitors don't need to empty your site's cache anymore to view the newest changes.</p>
    <p><b>Not working?</b> Read through this guide again to make sure you did everything correctly. Take care that the values for the variables (file names) are correct.</p>

    <summary>The small print</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Service workers require HTTPS. Chances are, the hoster you use for your website <i>does</i> use HTTPS. If your website's URL starts with <code>http<u>s</u>://</code> you're all good! However,
        if it starts with <code>http://</code> (no "s") then this solution might not work for you. Use <a href="#automated">Query String Versioning</a> instead.
      </li>
      <li>The extra file that is needed for the service worker (<code>service-worker.js</code>) means your website will take slightly longer to finish loading.</li>
      <li>If a visitor (or you) is currently viewing your website while you are pulishing a change, a normal page refresh is obviously still necessary to see the changes.</li>
      <li>I did not write the code for the service worker myself (I only modified it), and only recently learned how all of this works, so excuse any mistakes.</li>
