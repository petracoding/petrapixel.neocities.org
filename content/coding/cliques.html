  <h1>List of Text Cliques</h1>
  <i class="fa-solid fa-list-ul"></i>
  <p>
    On this page you can find a list of text cliques and pixel cliques that you can join if you have a website! As far as I can tell, this is already the most comprehensive list of web cliques on the
    Internet - and you can help expand it! Got questions? Check out the <a href="#faq">FAQ</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>If you know a clique that isn't on the list yet, please <a href="https://forms.gle/CEa9bg7ZZV2x3qBY8" target="_blank">submit it here</a>!</b> You can submit any clique, it doesn't have to be
    your own! Your submission should appear in the list once you refresh this page after submitting.
  </p>
  <p>
    If there is information of a clique already in the list that needs to be changed (e.g. URL of clique changed, clique is now closed, ...) please use
    <a href="https://forms.gle/Mtk1gXzwfWW9vV9A8" target="_blank">this form</a>. I go through these manually so please only do this when necessary.
  </p>

      best to keep it clean, but be aware that I am not the author of all the information below and therefore might not agree with it. I will spam-proof and/or moderate responses in the future if it

  <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
  <br />

  <b>What is a (text) clique and how can I join one?</b>
  <p>
    A clique is like a little club you can join that connects websites of common interests, values, etc. There's not really a point to them other than that and expressing your interests on your
    website. Cliques are very casual compared to webrings, and it's easy to join them:
  </p>
  <p>
    You join a clique by simply copying the text/code, adding any missing information, and adding it to your website. The page of a clique will usually tell you exactly what to do. If the clique has a
    members list (and not all do) you should also fill out the form so that you can be added to the list.
  </p>
  <br />

  <b>What is the difference between a clique and a fanlisting?</b>
  <p>
    There is no clear difference. Fanlistings, traditionally, have images in specific sizes (e.g. 50x50, 100x50) that you add to your website instead of text. Fanlistings also always have a member
    list, meanwhile only some cliques have member lists. Some cliques use fanlisting functionality for their members list and offer both text links (like a clique) and images (like a fanlisting).
  </p>
  <p>This list does not include fanlistings that do not offer a text code like cliques do.</p>
  <br />

  <b>What is a pixel clique?</b>
  <p>
    A pixel clique is a clique you join my creating a pixel sprite (often based on an existing template) of something, e.g. an egg. You then add your sprite and other peoples' sprites to your website.
  </p>
  <br />

  <b>How can I make my own clique?</b>
  <p>
    Just make one! Since a members list is not required, you can literally just make a clique up, share it with others, and boom - you're done! If you want to have a members list you can use Google
    Forms or something similar to collect responses. Some cliques also use <a href="https://thefanlistings.org/start/apply.php" target="_blank">fanlisting functionality</a>.
