  <h1>Git & GitHub Tutorial</h1>
  <i class="fa-solid fa-code-branch"></i>
  <p>
    When I tried to learn git I had a lot of trouble, because even though they are 'beginner tutorials' out there, all of them were either too complicated to too minimalistic. So, here's my attempt to
    teach you exactly the steps you need to use git as a beginner.
  </p>
  <p><b>Why to use Git:</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>You will be able to see the change history of your files. If you break something, you can easily restore old versions of files.</li>
    <li>You will have an online version of your project, which you can share with others. (It's also a neat backup so your project can't be lost!)</li>
    <li>You will be able to work with other people on your project.</li>
    <li>If you connect your repository to the host of your website (e.g. Neocities), all changes will automatically be uploaded there as well. (See step 5 for details.)</li>
  </ul>
  <br />

    <p>If you want to look at an example GitHub repository, check out <a href="https://github.com/petracoding/petrapixel.neocities.org" target="_blank">the one for this very website</a>!</p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote class="warning">
    This tutorial was written using git <b>version 2.41.0</b>. If you use a much older or newer version some of the information here might be outdated! You can check your version by running:
    <code>git -v</code>

  <h2>Understanding Git</h2>

  <h3>Git vs GitHub</h3>
  <p>First, let's look at SimpleWikipedia's definition of git and GitHub:</p>
  <blockquote class="tip">
    <strong>Git</strong> is a distributed revision control system. It is a computer program that helps people create other computer programs together. <strong>GitHub</strong> is an online software
    development assistance and version control service. This platform uses Git.
  </blockquote>
  <p>We will be working with both Git and GitHub. To clarify, this is the difference:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Git</strong> is the core technology, with which you can create git repositories.</li>
    <li><strong>GitHub.com</strong> is a web interface for git repositories. There are other ones too, but GitHub is by far the most popular.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You can think of a <em>repository</em> as a project. For example, I have a repository for a game I'm making and
    <a href="https://github.com/petracoding/petrapixel.neocities.org">another repository for my website</a> (go ahead and check it out to get a sense of what it looks like!)
  </p>

  <h3>What we'll do</h3>
  <p>
    We will be connecting our local files (aka the project on your PC) with your GitHub repository (aka the files uploaded to GitHub). Then, with just one command/click, you will be able to upload
    your local changes to the online repository. Other people can look at and download your repository (if you have set it to public). You will also be able to view the change history of every file.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also, other people can work on your repository (though all changes need to be approved by you, obviously). That's like, one of the main reasons to use git (besides version control). However, I
    will not go into this in detail. It's important to understand the basics first. And for your beginner project/website it's probably just you anyway.
  </p>
  <h3>The process</h3>
  <p>
    You will make changes in your project as usual. Once you've made a few changes you will choose ("<b>stage</b>") the changed files that belong together (for example a new feature, an edited page,
    etc.) We will then <b>commit</b> these chosen ("staged") files and give all of the changes a name, e.g. <i>"Update About-Me Page"</i>.
  </p>
  <p>Here's a great visualization (taken from <a href="https://www.edureka.co/blog/git-tutorial/" target="_blank">here</a>):</p>
  <img class="image" width="500" src="../assets/img/coding/git-tutorial/visualization.png" alt="Git visualization" />
  <p>Explanation of graphic:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The left 3 columns ("Local") represent the project on your computer.</li>
    <li>The rightmost column ("Remote") represents the project on GitHub.</li>
    <li>
      The arrows represent commands you will use when working with git:
      <ul>
        <li><code>git add</code> "stages" a file (or multiple files)</li>
        <li><code>git commit</code> "commits" all staged files (e.g. <i>"Update About-Me Page"</i>)</li>
        <li><code>git push</code> uploads all new commits to the project on GitHub</li>
        <li>
          <code>git pull</code> downloads the current state of the project on GitHub to your computer. (This is not necessary if you are the only person working on your project, as there will never be
          changes on GitHub that you haven't made yourself.)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Requirements</h2>

  <h3>Install Git</h3>
  <p>You need to have git installed on your device.</p>
  <p>
    Go <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">here</a> to download Git. If you're using <b>Windows</b> you can also download it
    <a href="https://gitforwindows.org/" target="_blank">here</a>.
  </p>
  <h3>GitHub Account</h3>
  <p>Create an account on <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github.com</a>, if you don't already have one.</p>
  <p>
    If you're using <b>VSCode</b> I highly recommend logging in with your GitHub account in VSCode. Go
    <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git" target="_blank">here</a> for more information.
  </p>
  <h3>How to use commands</h3>
  <p>You need to be able to use command line comments.</p>
  <p>
    If you're using <b>VSCode</b>, simply right-click the file tree on the left side of the program and choose "Open in Integrated Terminal". This will open the terminal on the bottom of the program:
  </p>
  <img class="image" src="../assets/img/coding/git-tutorial/1.png" alt="" />
  <img class="image" src="../assets/img/coding/git-tutorial/2.png" alt="" />
  <p>
    Other IDEs (= programs you code in) might also have integrated terminals. If you use Notepad++ or other simple editors to work on your code you can open a Windows terminal by
    <b>right-clicking in your folder in the Windows explorer and choosing "Open in Terminal"</b> (I'm using Windows 11 so it might be labelled differently for you). The Windows Powershell will open.
  </p>
  <p>Some very basic commands you should know: (<code>cd</code> stands for 'change directory')</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>cd ..</code> to move to the next folder up</li>
    <li><code>cd &lt;folder&gt;</code> to move into the folder, e.g. <code>cd images/gifs</code></li>
  </ul>
  <!-- <p>
            (Note: Technically, for many (not all) of the command you will learn it doesn't matter which folder you are in as long as it is in your project. However, I highly recommend staying in the
            root folder of your project for everything. So, basically, don't use the <code>cd</code> commands once you're in your project folder unless you know what you're doing.)
          </p> -->
  <p>To stop/cancel a running command you can use Ctrl+C.<br />If it's a git command, such as <code>git log</code>, you can end it by pressing <b>q</b> (short for 'quit').</p>

<section>
  <h2 id="new-project">1. Creating a new project</h2>

  <p>Go to GitHub and create an empty repository. You could call it <i>my-website</i> or <i>example.neocities.org</i> or something like that. Do <b>not</b> include a .README file.</p>
  <img class="image" src="../assets/img/coding/git-tutorial/0.png" alt="" />
  <p>On the repostiory page, copy the HTTPS (not SSH!) link. We will need this in a second.</p>
  <img class="image" src="../assets/img/coding/git-tutorial/3b.png" alt="" />
  <p>(If you want to find this link later, it will be in the "Code" menu:)</p>
  <img class="image" src="../assets/img/coding/git-tutorial/3.png" alt="" />
  <p>Open a terminal in your project folder. (If you don't have a project folder yet create it now and add at least one file.)</p>
  <!-- <p>
            Choose whether you want to call your primary branch <em>main</em> or <em>master</em> . (It doesn't really matter. <em>master</em> used to be the default, and is still extremely common, but
            <em>main</em> is the default now.) I will use <em>main</em> for all following examples.
          </p> -->
  <p>Then execute the following commands one by one: (In the second one, replace <code>&lt;https link&gt;</code> with the link you just copied!)</p>
  <div class="snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto">
    <pre><code>git init
git remote add origin &lt;https link&gt;
git add .
git commit -m "First Commit"
git branch -M main
git push --set-upstream origin main
git pull --set-upstream origin main</code></pre>
  </div>
  <p>Explanation:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>git init</code> initalizes your current folder as a git repository</li>
    <li><code>git remote add origin ...</code> connects your local folder with the GitHub repository you have created on github.com</li>
    <li><code>git add .</code> stages all your files. (you will learn what this means in a second)</li>
    <li><code>git commit -m "First Commit"</code> commits the staged files. (you will learn what this means in a second)</li>
    <li><code>git branch -M main</code> renames the branch to 'main'. This is sometimes necessary because sometimes the branch is called 'master' by default, which is wrong for our example.</li>
    <li>
      <code>git push --set-upstream origin main</code> pushes (= uploads) your local files to your GitHub repository. This is also where we define the <em>main</em> branch as the default target for
      this command, which we will only have to do this one time.
    </li>

    <li>
      <code>git pull --set-upstream origin main</code> pulls (= downloads) the files in your GitHub repository into your local folder. (Right now this won't do anything because the files in your
      GitHub repostiory and your PC are the same.) This is also where we define the <em>main</em> branch as the default target for this command, which we will only have to do this one time.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  <details>
    <summary>Troubleshooting</summary>
    <p>If you get the error <code>"error: remote origin already exists."</code> execute <code>git remote rm origin</code> and try again.</p>
    <p>If you initalized the GitHub repository with a .README file, you might have to execute these commands instead:</p>
    <pre><code>git init
git remote add origin &lt;https link&gt;
git switch -c main
git add .
git commit -m "First Commit"
git pull --set-upstream origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
git push --set-upstream origin main</code></pre>
    <b>Broken something? Want to restart?</b>
    <p>
      If you want your project folder not to be a git repository anymore, you have to delete the (hidden) <code>.git</code> folder in the project: Open your project in the Windows Explorer, make
      visible files and folders visible in the settings of the Windows Explorer, and delete the <code>.git</code> folder. You can now start from the beginning (<code>git init</code> and so on).
    </p>
  </details>

  <br />
  <p>You should now see your project files in your repository on GitHub.com!</p>
  <blockquote class="success">The set-up for this project is now done. What you will learn next is what you will do whenever you work on your project!</blockquote>

  <h2 id="staging">2. Staging changes</h2>

  <p>
    Edit your code as you usually would. Once you want to "save" your changes it's time to add all changed files that you want to "save" to the so-called <i>staging area</i> by <b>staging</b> them.
    You can think of this step as <b>choosing which files to save together as a feature</b>.
  </p>

  <p>When using commands, execute this for every file:</p>
  <div class="snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto">
    <pre><code>git add &lt;file&gt;</code></pre>
  </div>
  <p>...for example: <code>git add index.html</code></p>
  <p>If you want to stage multiple files at once you can do something like this: (this would stage every changed file in the 'blog' folder) <code>git add blog/.</code></p>

  <p>To stage <em>every</em> changed file, you can simply do: <code>git add .</code></p>
  <p><strong>Or: </strong>When using the VSCode UI simply press the small "+" next any changed file to stage it:</p>
  <img class="image" src="../assets/img/coding/git-tutorial/4.png" alt="" />

  <!-- <p>
            To stage only a <strong>part</strong> of a file, you can use: <code>git add -p &lt;filename&gt;</code> and define for every line what you want to do. (y=stage,n=not stage,q=not stage and
            no more,a=stage and all others,s=split,e=manually edit with + and - and #)
          </p> -->

  <br />
  <details>
    <summary>Show me how to un-stage files</summary>
    <h3>Unstaging Files</h3>
    <p>When unstaging files your changes will <b>not</b> be undone. The only thing that changes is the status of the file: It will change from staged to unstaged.</p>
    <p>To un-stage files/folders, execute <code>git restore --staged &lt;file&gt;</code> or <code>git reset HEAD -- &lt;file&gt;</code> (They do the same thing.)</p>
    <p><strong>Or: </strong>When using the VSCode UI simply press the small "-" next to any staged file to unstage it:</p>
    <img class="image" src="../assets/img/coding/git-tutorial/5.png" alt="" />
    <br />
  </details>
  <br />
  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      <b>Important tip:</b> To show the <b>status</b> of all files, use <code><b>git status</b></code
      >. <br />This will show you which files have been changed, and whether these changes are already staged or not. Keep in mind that one file can be both staged and unstaged if you made changes in
      it after staging other changes.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</section>
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<section>
  <h2 id="committing">3. Committing changes</h2>

  <p>Every staged file can then be 'commited'. You can think of this as "saving" all the changes that belong together (e.g. a feature, new page, bugfix).</p>
  <p>When using commands, execute this once: (-m stands for message, which is the title you give your commit)</p>
  <div class="snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto">
    <pre><code>git commit -m "Example message"</code></pre>
  </div>
  <p><strong>Or: </strong>When using the VSCode UI simply type your message into the input box at the top and click 'Commit':</p>
  <img class="image" src="../assets/img/coding/git-tutorial/6.png" alt="" />
  <p>Some <strong>good</strong> examples for commit messages:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>"BUGFIX: Fix order of gallery items"</li>
    <li>"Create gallery element"</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Some <strong>bad</strong> examples for commit messages:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>"i changed the color of the title" (too narrative)</li>
    <li>"update" (too indescriptive)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Amending changes</h3>
  <p>If you want to add more changes to your most recent commit instead of creating yet another commit, you can amend your changes.</p>
  <details>
    <summary>Show me how to amend changes</summary>
    <p><b>Only do this if you haven't pushed your most recent commit yet!</b></p>
    <p><b>Stage your files</b> as you usually would. Then, instead of using <code>git commit</code>, do:</p>
    <pre><code>git commit --amend -m "an updated commit message"</code></pre>
    <p>or, if you don't want to change your previous commit message, you can do:</p>
    <pre><code>git commit --amend --no-edit</code></pre>
    <p>This will add your changes to your most recent commit. The commit message will stay unchanged.</p>
    <p><strong>Or: </strong>If you're using VSCode you can open the submenu of the "Commit" button and click "Commit (Amend)":</p>
    <img class="image" src="../assets/img/coding/git-tutorial/amend.png" alt="" />
  </details>

  <h3>Undoing commits</h3>
  <p>If you commited something that you didn't mean to, you can undo it.</p>
  <details>
    <summary>Show me how to undo commits</summary>
    <p>There are two ways to "undo" a commit.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Revert</strong> = It's as if someone had gone it and changed everything back; the changes stay visible in the edit history of the file.</li>
      <li><strong>Reset</strong> = It's as if the commit had never happened. (Not recommended.)</li>
    </ul>

    <br />
    <h4>How to Revert</h4>
    <p>To <b>revert</b> a commit you can execute:</p>
    <div class="snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto">
      <pre><code>git revert --no-edit &lt;commit_hash&gt;</code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>That will create a new commit that undoes the changes in your previous commit.</p>
    <p>
      You can find the <b>commit hash</b> of your previous commit by showing a list of the previous commits with <code>git log --oneline</code>. The hash could look like this: <i>fcd745f</i> or this:
      <i>fcd745f74822c61cf30442407165c1b86fe5ccf5</i> . (How to copy the ID depends on which terminal you're using. Perhaps Ctrl+C as usual, perhaps selecting the ID and right-clicking to paste it
      into the current command, perhaps in a completely different way.)
    </p>

    <br />
    <h4>How to Reset</h4>
    <p>To <b>reset</b> a commit <b>that has not been pushed yet</b> you can execute:</p>
    <div class="snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto">
      <pre><code>git reset &lt;previous_commit_hash&gt;</code></pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      You need to use the commit hash of the commit you want to <b>reset to</b>, <u>not</u> of the commit you are resetting. This means you have to use the commit hash of your second-to-last commit.
    </p>
    <p>After executing this command the commit will be undone, but the edits you want gone are still there as unstaged changes. You can undo them manually or use <code>git restore .</code></p>
  </details>
</section>
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<section>
  <h2 id="pushing">4. Pushing changes</h2>

  <p>Now that you have created your commit(s), we can push (= upload) them into the repostiory.</p>
  <p>Simply execute:</p>
  <div class="snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto">
    <pre><code>git push</code></pre>
  </div>
  <p><strong>Or: </strong>When using the VSCode UI simply press "Sync Changes":</p>
  <img class="image" src="../assets/img/coding/git-tutorial/7.png" alt="" />
  <p>Now, if you refresh your GitHub page, you should see the changes.</p>
  <p>If you click on the "Commits" button you can see a list of all your previous commits/changes.</p>
  <img class="image" src="../assets/img/coding/git-tutorial/8.png" alt="" />

  <h2 id="neocities">Connecting to Neocities <small>(Optional)</small></h2>

  <p>
    With the help of a <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-neocities" target="_blank">GitHub Action</a> you can connect your repository to your Neocities website. This way, all
    changes to your GitHub repository will be automatically uploaded to Neocities the moment you <b>push</b> them. (It only updates the files that were actually changed, don't worry about your
    Neocities feed.)
  </p>
  <!-- <p>Please read <a href="https://petrapixel.neocities.org/coding/neocities.html#github-action" rel="nofollow">the guide</a> for more information.</p> -->

  <h4>How to set it up:</h4>
  <ol class="list-with-more-spacing" style="padding-left: 1em">
    <li>Make sure all the files in your project that should be uploaded to Neocities are in a folder called <i>public</i>.</li>
    <li>
      Create the following file in the root of your project (<i>NOT</i> in the <i>public</i> folder):<br /><code>.github/workflows/neocities.yml</code> <br />Make sure you spell it correctly! Don't
      forget the "." at the start of the first folder name.
    </li>
    <li>Insert the code shown <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-neocities#usage" target="_blank">here</a> into your file.</li>
    <li>If your branch is called 'main' instead of 'master' make sure to change that on line 7.</li>
    <li>Comment out (= add a # at the start of the lines) or delete lines 20 to 31. You don't need them.</li>
    <li>
      If you want to you can set <i>cleanup</i> to <i>true</i>. This means that files that are still in your Neocities but not in your project anymore are deleted from Neocities. (I recommend this,
      otherwise you will eventually run out of space in your Neocities account.)
    </li>
    <li>
      Get your API Key for your Neocities account. (It can be found in your Site Settings on Neocities under "<span style="text-transform: none">API</span>").<br />
      <img class="image" src="../assets/img/coding/git-tutorial/api1.png" alt="" />
    </li>
    <li>
      Open your repository on GitHub, go to its "Settings", then "Secrets and Variables" -&gt; "Actions". Add a secret with the name
      <span style="text-transform: none">NEOCITIES_API_TOKEN</span> and set your Neocities API Key as the value.<br />
      <img class="image" src="../assets/img/coding/git-tutorial/api2.png" alt="" />
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Done! Now whenever you push to your master/main branch, the changed/added files will automatically be uploaded to your Neocities site.</p>
</section>
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<section>
  <h2 id="pr">Pull Requests</h2>
  <p>
    <b>Pull Requests</b> (<b>PR</b> for short) are what you have to create if you want to suggest changes to <b>somebody else's</b> project. They are called pull requests because you are requesting
    that they pull (= download/save) the changes you've made in their project.
  </p>
  <p>
    If your change is really small you can make a PR on GitHub without even opening an code editor on your computer. Just open the file on GitHub that you want to change (e.g. README.md) and click the
    edit button. GitHub will tell you that you need to create a <b>Fork</b> of the project. This means a copy of the entire project will be created in your GitHub Account. Once you do this, you can
    edit the file and save it (commit it). Then, GitHub will tell you that you're now ready to create a pull request. Once you click the green button you can type in the PR information (title,
    optional description) and post it. The whole process takes less than a minute - it's that easy!
  </p>
  <p>For larger changes, the process for creating a PR is as follows:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Fork the repository by pressing the Fork button (a copy of the project will be created in your account)</li>
    <li>Clone the repository (= download it to your computer so you can work on it, as usual)</li>
    <li>Create a new branch for your change and switch into that branch. e.g. <code>git checkout -b my-change</code></li>
    <li>Make your changes</li>
    <li>Stage and commit your changes as usual</li>
    <li>Push the changes on your branch (e.g. <code>git push origin my-change</code>)</li>
    <li>Go to the repository in your account (= the fork) and you will see the green button to create a PR!</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Once you've created a PR, it's the project's team's job to look at your PR and either accept it (in which case your changes will be added to the project) or decline it.</p>

  <h2 id="branches">Branches</h2>
  <p>
    Branches are ways to have multiple versions of your project at once. That way, you can work on a feature (on a seperate branch), and only once it's fully done merge the branch into your main
    branch.
  </p>
  <p>I won't be going into detail here because there a hundreds of great tutorials on git branches out there.</p>
  <p>The most important commands:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Show branches: <code>git branch</code></li>
    <li>Switch to a branch: <code>git checkout my-branch</code></li>
    <li>
      Make new branch and check it out: <code>git switch -c &lt;new-branch&gt;</code><br />(used to be <code>git checkout -b &lt;new-branch&gt;</code>. more info
      <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1394804/3187492" target="_blank">here</a>.)
    </li>
    <li>Add current changes to new branch: Do the above, your changes will be kept</li>
  </ul>
</section>

  <h2>Additional Commands</h2>

  <p>Here are some additional commands that can be helpful.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To show all files and their current state (e.g. not staged, staged): <code>git status</code></li>
    <li>To show a log of all commits: <code>git log --oneline</code> or <code>git log</code></li>
    <li>To show all changes: <code>git diff</code>, or just a specific file/folder: <code>git diff &lt;path&gt;</code></li>
    <li>To discard the changes in a (not-yet-staged) file: <code>git restore &lt;file&gt;</code> or all: <code>git restore .</code></li>
    <li>To show the git version you're using: <code>git -v</code></li>
  </ul>
