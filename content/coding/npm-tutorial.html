  <h2 id="command-line">Command Line</h2>
  <p>
    In this tutorial we will be executing commands in a command line. If you're using Windows you can use the <b>Windows PowerShell</b> for this (you might have to open it as an administrator). If
    you're using VSCode to code you can also open a <b>terminal in VSCode</b> (right-click on file tree and choose &quot;Open in Integrated Terminal&quot;, OR in the top menu: Terminal -> New
    Terminal).
  </p>
  <img class="image" img src="../assets/img/coding/git-tutorial/1.png" alt="" />
  <img class="image" src="../assets/img/coding/git-tutorial/2.png" alt="" />
  <p>
    When I give you a command, for example <code>npm --version</code>, this means you have to type that in and press enter. It will output one or multiple lines of information (in this case your
    installed version of npm).
  </p>
  <blockquote class="tip">
    <b>Tip</b>: You can use the up-arrow key on your keyboard to load the most recent command. This is practical if you have a command you need to execute again and again.
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Make sure the current path in your terminal is the root folder of your project (e.g. <code>D:\Projects\my-project</code>). The current path in your terminal is shown to the left of where you type.
    If you've opened the integrated terminal in VSCode the path should already be correct. If you need to change the path of the terminal you can do this with the <i>cd</i> command (= &quot;change
    directory&quot;):
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>cd ..</code> will go one folder up.</li>
    <li><code>cd &lt;path&gt;</code> (e.g. <code>cd D:\Projects\my-project</code> or <code>cd my-project</code>) will switch to that directory</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>
  <p>Before we start we need to define some terms.</p>
  <p>
    <b>Node.js (Node)</b> is a JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Check if you have it installed via <code>node --version</code>. When you install
    Node.js, npm is also automatically installed.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>npm (Node Package Manager)</b> is a tool which will allow you to install third party libraries/packages (other people's code, such as webpack or eleventy) by using the command line. Check if
    you have it installed via <code>npm --version</code>. When you install Node.js, npm is automatically installed, which means you don't need to install this seperately.
  </p>
  <blockquote class="tip">FYI: We will be installing node and npm <b>globally</b> (once on your device) and all packages <b>locally</b> (once per project).</blockquote>
  <details>
    <summary>Additional Definitions</summary>
    <p>You don't technically <i>need</i> to know this, but it's good to know, especially when following tutorials online.</p>
    <p>
      <b>nvm (Node Version Manager)</b> <i>(Not to be confused with npm!)</i> is a tool that allows you to download and install multiple different versions of Node.js. Check if you have it installed
      with <code>nvm --version</code>. We will <b>not</b> use nvm in this tutorial, but be aware of its existence (and how its different from npm) when googling!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>npx (Node Package Executor)</b> <i>(Not to be confused with npm!)</i> is a tool that lets you execute commands from packages without the need to add them as a dependency, e.g.
      <code>npx webpack</code> without having webpack installed. (npx essentially installs the package temporarily.) It's good to try things out. If you <i>do</i> have the package installed it does
      use the installed version instead, so don't be confused if (for example) tutorials tell you to use <code>npx webpack</code> even though you have webpack installed as a dependency. npx is
      automatically installed when you install npm, so you don't need to do any additional work to use it.
    </p>
  </details>

  <hr />
  <b>Some examples of packages you can install with npm:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Webpack</b> will take all your CSS, SCSS and JavaScript files and generate one big JavaScript file out of them all. Webpack itself requires a bunch of other packages (such as
      <i>css-loader</i>) to work. (I have a tutorial on how to set it up here.) <i>My tutorial is coming soon.</i>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Eleventy</b> is a static site generator. You can create &quot;templates&quot; (either .html or .njk files) and re-use them. This way you don't have to edit your header in every single page
      file, etc. Then you execute a command, and Eleventy will generate all your page files for you. These files you can upload to your website as you normally would. (I have a tutorial on how to set
      it up here.) <a href="/coding/eleventy-tutorial">Here is my tutorial.</a>
    </li>
    <li><b>tippy.js</b> styles your tooltips</li>
    <li>and many many many more...</li>
  </ul>

<section>
  <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
  <p>
    First, we will need to install Node.js on our device. Download the node.js installer from <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer" target="_blank">here</a> and execute it to
    install Node.js on your computer.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will now check if the installation was successful. Open a terminal of your choice (e.g. Windows PowerShell, or a terminal in VSCode) and execute the command <code>node -v</code>. It should show
    the version you just installed.
  </p>
  <p>Also execute <code>npm -v</code> to check if npm was also successfully installed (it will show a different version than node, that's okay).</p>
  <p>If both commands work and show you a version you have successfully installed node and npm! :)</p>
  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      <b>Tip:</b> If you ever need a newer version of node, just download the newer installer and go through the installation wizard again. It will replace your current version with the newer one.
      Only do this if you know it won't mess with your projects!
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote class="tip">
    <b>Note:</b> If you need multiple different node versions on your computer because you have projects that require different node versions, you can use nvm (Node Version manager) (not to be
    confused with npm). This tutorial will <b>not</b> include this.
  </blockquote>

  <p>Once you've installed node and npm you don't need to do it again. It's installed on your device, not in your project, so you can use it in all your projects.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="project-setup">Project Setup</h2>
  <p>
    We will now initalize our project as an npm project. We do this by creating a file with the name <code>package.json</code> in the root folder of our project (e.g.
    <code>D:\Projects\my-project\package.json</code>)..
  </p>
  <p>Add this in the file:</p>
  <pre><code>{
  <span class="hljs-attr">"name"</span>: <span>"your-project-name"</span>,
  <span class="hljs-attr">"private"</span>: <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>
}
</code></pre>
  <p>You can add more information, such as <i>version</i> or <i>description</i> and custom commands (see below), but that's all optional for most projects, especially small/personal projects.</p>
  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>(Alternatively, instead of creating the file yourself, you can run the <code>npm init</code> command, which will ask you some questions about your project and generate the file for you.)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Done! Now you can now start installing packages.</p>

  <hr />
  <h3 id="custom-commands">Custom Commands</h3>
  <p>In the <code>package.json</code> you can define custom commands to &quot;replace&quot; other commands. The command for custom commands is always <code>npm run &lt;command name&gt;</code>.</p>
  <p>For example:</p>
  <pre><code><span>"scripts"</span>: {
    <span>"build"</span>: <span>"npx @11ty/eleventy"</span>
}
</code></pre>
  <p>will run the command <code>npx @11ty/eleventy</code> when you execute <code>npm run build</code>.</p>
  <p>You can even run two commands with one (seperated by a <code>&amp;</code>), for example:</p>
  <pre><code><span>"scripts"</span>: {
    <span>"build"</span>: <span>"npx @11ty/eleventy &amp; webpack"</span>
}
</code></pre>
  <p>will run the commands <code>npx @11ty/eleventy</code> <i>and</i> <code>webpack</code> when you execute <code>npm run build</code>.</p>
  <p>More info on custom commands <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/using-npm/scripts" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="gitignore">GitIgnore</h2>
  <p>
    If your project is a git repository you should add <code>node_modules</code> to your gitignore file, because the folder should not be added to your repository (because it is quite large and
    generated automatically).
  </p>
  <p>
    If you don't have a gitignore file yet, create it like this: In the root folder of your project, create a file with the name <code>.gitignore</code> (don't forget the period at the start). In it,
    type <code>node_modules</code>. This will make git ignore the <code>node_modules</code> folder, as if it wasn't there.
  </p>
  <blockquote class="help">Don't know what Git is? <a href="/coding/git-tutorial">Check out my git tutorial.</a></blockquote>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="installing-packages">Installing Packages</h2>

  <p>You can install packages using this command: <code>npm install &lt;package&gt;</code>, e.g. <code>npm install webpack</code>.</p>
  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      <b>Note:</b> Packages are either installed as dependencies or development dependencies (devDependencies). The distinction is probably not important to you as a beginner: either is fine. To
      install a package as a devDependency use this command: <code>npm install &lt;package&gt; --save-dev</code>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Here's what happens when you install a package: npm checks if that package exists, looks for the most recent version of it, and tries to download and install the package. If successful, these
    things happen:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The package name and version will be added to the list of dependencies in your <code>package.json</code> file.</li>
    <li>A <code>package-lock.json</code> will be created, which contains information about all installed packages. (You won't need to look at this file, but don't delete it.)</li>
    <li>A <code>node_modules</code> folder will be created in your project which contains the necessary files for this package.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <b>You should never manually edit anything in the <code>node_modules</code> folder or the <code>package-lock.json</code> file.</b> (And you won't have to, anyway.) Since these files are generated
    automatically any changes you make in them would be soon overwritten.
  </p>
  <p>If, instead of these things happening, you get an error read the 'troubleshooting' section below.</p>
  <p>You can uninstall packages by running <code>npm uninstall &lt;package&gt;</code>.</p>

  <hr />
  <h3 id="understanding-dependencies">Understanding Dependencies in <i>package.json</i></h3>
  <p>Once you have some packages installed they will be listed in your <code>package.json</code> file, e.g.:</p>
  <pre><code><span>"devDependencies"</span>: {
    <span>"@11ty/eleventy"</span>: <span>"^2.0.1"</span>,
    <span>"css-loader"</span>: <span>"^7.1.2"</span>,
    <span>"sass"</span>: <span>"^1.77.8"</span>,
    <span>"sass-loader"</span>: <span>"^16.0.1"</span>,
    <span>"style-loader"</span>: <span>"^4.0.0"</span>,
    <span>"tippy.js"</span>: <span>"^6.3.7"</span>,
    <span>"webpack"</span>: <span>"^5.94.x"</span>,
    <span>"webpack-cli"</span>: <span>"^5.1.4"</span>
  },
</code></pre>
  <p>The first value is the name of the package, the second is the version rule. The version rules can look like this:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>1.2.3</code>: only version 1.2.3, nothing else</li>
    <li><code>^1.2.3</code>: version 1.2.3 or higher, but below 2.0</li>
    <li><code>~1.2.3</code>: version 1.2.3 or higher, but below 1.3</li>
    <li><code>1.x.x</code>: version 1.0.0 or higher, but below 2.0</li>
    <li><code>1.2.x</code>: version 1.2.0 or higher, but below 1.3</li>
    <li><code>*</code>: any version</li>
  </ul>
  <p>and so on.</p>
  <p>
    You <i>can</i> edit these manually and install them by running <code>npm install</code> (more info on that later). However, it's also possible to install/update/deinstall packages with command
    line commands alone, without editing this file manually.
  </p>
  <blockquote class="tip">
    <p>
      These version rules are based on <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning" target="_blank">semantic versioning</a>. Essentially, this just means that the first number is a
      <b>major release</b> (which breaks backward comaptibility), the second number is a <b>minor release</b> (which adds new features), and the third number is a <b>patch release</b> (which fixes
      bugs). Sometimes, the second and/or third number is left out, which implies &quot;.0&quot; (e.g. 1.3 = 1.3.0)
    </p>

<section>
  <h2 id="npm-install-update"><i>npm install</i> and <i>npm update</i></h2>
  <p>One more thing you need to know:</p>
  <p>
    The command <code>npm install</code> (without specifying a package) 'reads' the dependency list in your <code>package.json</code> file and makes sure all packages are installed in the right
    version. If, for some reason, you delete your <code>node_modules</code> folder or <code>package-lock.json</code>, you can get them back with <code>npm install</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is also the command <code>npm update</code>, which (confusingly) does the same thing as <code>npm install</code> but also checks for newer versions of packages. You probably won't need this
    unless you're planning on updating to newer version of a package.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
  <p>
    <b>Clean Slate:</b> If you feel like you messed up everything, just delete the entire <code>node_modules</code> folder and the <code>package-lock.json</code> file, make sure your dependency list
    is correct, and execute <code>npm install</code> again for a &quot;fresh&quot; install.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Cache Problem:</b> If you get an error along the lines of <code>Failed to remove some directories. EPERM: operation not permitted on Windows</code>, execute
    <code>npm cache clean --force</code> and try whatever you did again.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Dependency Conflicts:</b> Packages that you install need to fit together. For example, if you install <i>package-a</i> and it required version 1.2-1.5 of <i>package-b</i>, and you then try to
    install version 3.6 of <i>package-b</i> it obviously won't work! Problems like these are called conflicts, and how to resolve them depends on what you're trying to do. In the example I just gave,
    one solution would be to check for a newer version of <i>package-a</i> that requires a more up-to-date version of <i>package-b</i>. Alternatively, you could also install an older version of
    <i>package-b</i> so that the requirement of <i>package-a</i> is fulfilled. For a more detailed explanation, read 'How to Resolve Conflicts' below.
  </p>

  <hr />
  <h3 id="resolving-conflicts">How to Resolve Conflicts</h3>
  <details>
    <summary>Read</summary>
    <p>Imagine our package.json contains these two dependencies for <i>package-a</i> and <i>package-b</i>:</p>
    <pre><code><span class="hljs-comment">"devDependencies"</span>: {
    <span class="hljs-comment">"package-a"</span>: <span class="hljs-comment">"^5.74.0"</span>,
    <span class="hljs-comment">"package-b"</span>: <span class="hljs-comment">"^3.3.11"</span>
},
</code></pre>
    <p>Let's say we try to run <code>npm install</code> and get this error, which shows a conflict between the packages <i>package-a</i> and <i>package-b</i>:</p>
    <pre><code>While resolving: my-<span class="hljs-symbol">project@</span>undefined
Found: <span class="hljs-keyword">package</span>-<span class="hljs-symbol">a@</span><span class="hljs-number">5.94</span><span class="hljs-number">.0</span>

dev <span class="hljs-keyword">package</span>-<span class="hljs-symbol">b@</span><span>"^3.3.11"</span> from the root project
</code></pre>
    <p>I know it looks confusing, but let's go through it line-by-line.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><code>While resolving: my-project@undefined</code> tells us that in our project (with the name <i>my-project</i>) there was an error found. Alright, we already knew this.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>Found: package-a@5.94.0</code> tells us that npm found the version 5.94.0 of <i>package-a</i> and is trying to install it.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <code>dev package-a@&quot;^5.74.0&quot; from the root project</code> tells us that in our <i>package.json</i> file we have defined that we want to have <i>package-a</i> version 5.74 or
          higher, but under 6.0. That's why <i>package-a</i> is trying to install 5.94.0: It's the most up-to-date version of <i>package-a</i> that fulfills the rule we have defined.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>Could not resolve dependency:</code> is a clear hint that this is a version conflict. Let's continue reading to understand what the problem is.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>peer package-a@&quot;4.x.x&quot; from package-b@3.3.12</code> tells us two things:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>npm found version 3.3.12 of <i>package-b</i> and wants to install it, because it's the most up-to-date version of <i>package-b</i> which fulfills the rule we have defined.</li>
          <li>
            Version 3.3.12 of <i>package-b</i>, however, requires <i>package-a</i> version 4.x.x (so any version above 4.0 and below 5.0). This is a problem, because npm wants to install
            <i>package-a</i> 5.94.0, which is too high!
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>node_modules/package-b</code> - this line isn't important, it just tells us where our <i>package-b</i> package is located.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <code>dev package-b@&quot;^3.3.11&quot; from the root project</code> reminds us of the fact that, in our <i>package.json</i>, we define the rule that we want version 3.3.11 or higher (but
          below 4.0) of the pacakage <i>package-b</i>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      So, the problem is that, according to the rules we defined in our <code>package.json</code>, we want <b>package-a@&quot;^5.74.0&quot;</b> (= 5.74 or higher but below 6.0) and
      <b>package-b@&quot;^3.3.11&quot;</b> (= 3.3.11 or higher but below 4.0), but <i>package-b</i> at that version needs <b>package-a@&quot;4.x.x&quot;</b> (= 4.0.0 or higher but below 5.0).
    </p>
    <p><b>Solution:</b> Update <i>package-b</i> so it requires the version of <i>package-a</i> we're using. <b>OR:</b> Downgrade <i>package-a</i> so it fits what <i>package-b</i> wants.</p>
    <p>
      You can update/downgrade a package by deinstalling it and installing it at a different version, or by manually editing the rule in the <code>package.json</code> file and running
      <code>npm install</code> (in the hopes that the dependencies now fit together so that there won't be a conflict anymore).
