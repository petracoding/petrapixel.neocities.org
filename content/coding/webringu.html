  <h1>Webringu</h1>
  <i class="fa-solid fa-ring"></i>
  <p>
    <b>Webringu is a super simple, easy-to-use and customizable webring script so you can create your own webring today!</b> <img aria-hidden="true" alt="" src="/assets/img/inline/happy.gif" /> I also
    use it for my own webring, the <a href="/webring">Code Collective</a>. Webringu was inspired by other webring scripts such as
    <a href="https://garlic.garden/onionring/" target="_blank">OnionRing</a> and <a href="https://juneish.neocities.org/old/written/resources/?page=webstring" target="_blank">june's webstring</a>. The
    name 'Webringu' is inspired by the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(film)" target="_blank" title="Horror warning!">Ringu (1998)</a> (which is the Japanese original of 'The
    Ring').
  </p>

  <h3>What it does (and doesn't)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Webringu is super easy to use. It doesn't require any JavaScript knowledge beyond editing a simple members array.</li>
    <li>Webringu <b>will work for free Neocities accounts</b> (for both you and your members).</li>
    <li>Webringu doesn't require your webring's members to include a bloaty script or CSS file on their site. Just simple links.</li>
    <li>Webringu gives you complete freedom for how the webring widget looks.</li>
    <li>Webringu provides you with <b>next</b>, <b>previous</b> and <b>random</b> links to use in your widgets.</li>
    <li>You can edit Webringu's code to your liking if you know what you're doing.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    But... Webringu <b>doesn't</b> update your members list automatically. You have to do that manually in the code. However, it can then automatically output the members list on your page. This way,
    you only have to keep one member list up-to-date (the one in the code).
  </p>

  <br />
  <p>
    <b>Webringu vs <a href="https://garlic.garden/onionring/" target="_blank">Onionring</a>:</b>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <mark>Onionring</mark> requires members to load 2-3 files on their site, which are about ~5 KB. If that member is also a part of 4 other webrings using the onionring script, that's already ~
      25KB, which can slow down site loading.<br /><mark>Webringu</mark> only requires a few lines of HTML, no files (0 KB). Even if someone has hundreds of webring widgets based on Webringu on their
      page it would still load 0 KB of files, so the website still loads quickly!
    </li>
    <li>
      <mark>Onionring</mark> loads the members' widget per JavaScript, which means its appearance is fixed.<br /><mark>Webringu</mark> only uses HTML, which means the widget is fully customizable for
      members.
    </li>
    <li>
      <mark>Onionring</mark>'s widget will not load for users with deactivated JavaScript.<br /><mark>Webringu</mark>'s widget will still be visible and link to the webring, even if a user's
      JavaScript is disabled.
    </li>
    <li>
      <mark>Onionring</mark> shows a "Not a member yet" message instead of its widget if the member has not been added.<br /><mark>Webringu</mark> shows the widget, but it only links to the webring
      page.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Onionring is not a bad script. In fact, it partially inspired Webringu. I just created Webringu because I wasn't entirely happy with Onionring; I wanted to create something that fit me better.
    Which script is 'better' depends on your taste.

  <h2>How To Use</h2>
  <h3>Your Code</h3>
  <p>
    First, create a page for your webring which will have all its information, rules, members list, etc. It does not matter whether this is a whole website on its own or just a singular page on your
    own website.
  </p>
  <p>On that page, use this code:</p>

  <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;script&gt;
  // List of members. You need to update this by hand. 
  const members = [
    {
      url: &quot;https://example0.com/&quot;,
      title: &quot;Example Website&quot;
    },
    {
      url: &quot;https://example1.com/&quot;,
      title: &quot;Example Website&quot;
    },
  ];
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://petrapixel.neocities.org/assets/js/webringu.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

  <blockquote class="warning">
    <p>
      <b>If you have a free Neocities account:</b> You won't be able to use an external script (last line of the code above). Instead,
      <a href="https://petrapixel.neocities.org/assets/js/webringu.js" target="_blank">download it</a>, name it <code>webringu.js</code>, upload it to your website and use it like so (this replaces
      the last line of the code above):
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;script src=&quot;/your-path-here/webringu.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>The rest of Webringu will work like normal.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>You need to keep the <code>members</code> array updated, e.g. when a new member joins, when someone leaves, when someone's URL changes, etc.</p>

  <hr />

  <h3>Member's Code</h3>
  <p>Now, assuming your webring page is <code>https://your-webring-page.neocities.org/webring</code> you can give the members of your webring a code that looks something like this:</p>

  <div class="my-webring-widget" style="margin: 30px 0 35px">
    <a href="https://your-webring-page.neocities.org/webring"><b>Your Webring Name</b></a
    ><br />
    <a href="https://your-webring-page.neocities.org/webring?action=previous">previous</a>
    <a href="https://your-webring-page.neocities.org/webring?action=random">random</a>
    <a href="https://your-webring-page.neocities.org/webring?action=next">next</a>
  </div>

  <p>This is the code for the widget:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div class=&quot;my-webring-widget&quot;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://your-webring-page.neocities.org/webring&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your Webring Name&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://your-webring-page.neocities.org/webring?action=previous&quot;&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://your-webring-page.neocities.org/webring?action=random&quot;&gt;random&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://your-webring-page.neocities.org/webring?action=next&quot;&gt;next&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

  <p>
    Obviously, add your real webring page URL and name (or image) in there. You can use arrows for the <i>next/previous</i> links (e.g. <span style="font-family: Arial">⤻ ⤺ → ← » « ⇨ ⇦</span>). You
    can remove the random link if you don't need it, and you can style the widgets however you want. I recommend simple styling that is achievable with inline CSS only; This way, your members don't
    have to add a CSS file to their site just to display the widget. But really, <b>you're free to do whatever you want here as long as the URLs are correct</b>.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h3>Optional: Members List</h3>
  <p>If you want an automatic table of your members outputted on your webring page, just add this element:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div id=&quot;webringulist&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;Please enable JavaScript to view the member list.&lt;/noscript&gt;</code></pre>
  <p>In this element, a table with all members will be rendered. It will look something like this:</p>

  <div id="webringulist" style="margin: 30px 0">
    <table class="webring-members">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Member</th>
          <th>Website</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Example0</td>
          <td>
            <a href="https://example0.com/">
              <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/petracoding/petrapixel.neocities.org@latest/public/assets/img/linkback.gif" width="88" />
              <div>example0.com</div>
            </a>
          </td>
          <td>Example Description</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Example1</td>
          <td>
            <a href="https://example1.com/">
              <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/petracoding/petrapixel.neocities.org@latest/public/assets/img/linkback.gif" width="88" />
              <div>example1.com</div>
            </a>
          </td>
          <td>Example Description</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Example2</td>
          <td>
            <a href="https://example2.com/">
              <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/petracoding/petrapixel.neocities.org@latest/public/assets/img/linkback.gif" width="88" />
              <div>example2.com</div>
            </a>
          </td>
          <td>Example Description</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p>You can style this table however you want.</p>

  <p>The description and website buttons will only be displayed if you defined them in the members list like so:</p>

  <pre><code class="language-javascript">{
  url: &quot;https://example1.com/&quot;,
  title: &quot;Example1&quot;,
  description: &quot;Example Description&quot;,
  buttonUrl: &quot;https://example1.com/button.png&quot;,
}</code></pre>

  <hr />

  <p>To output the number of members in the webring, use <code>&lt;span id=&quot;webringucount&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code>, e.g.:</p>

  <pre><code class="language-html">This webring has &lt;span id=&quot;webringucount&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; members.</code></pre>

  <hr />
