  <h1>Advent Calendar of Digital Challenges!</h1>
  <p>
    I thought it would be fun to create a little advent calendar for all you folks! Every door will have a <b>digital challenge</b> that has something to do with your phone, pc, the internet,
    software, etc. Most challenges are about <b>improving your digital experience/home</b>. Some can be done in 5 minutes, some might take an hour or longer. There's no need to do every single one -
    though I recommend it! No challenges will be specific to having your own website, so you can participate even if you don't have a website! If you enjoy this calendar please share it with others :3
    Btw, the doors can only be opened if it's actually that day (in your timezone) or later. <b>Happy Holidays!</b>

  <p>Please note there are only <b>24 doors</b> because that's how it is in my country, we celebrate on the 24th :)</p>
