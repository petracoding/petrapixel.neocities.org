  <h1>Advent Calendar of Digital Challenges!</h1>
  <p>
    I thought it would be fun to create a little advent calendar for all you folks! Every door will have a <b>digital challenge</b> that has something to do with your phone, pc, the internet,
    software, etc, as well as a bonus challenge that's a bit harder, for a total of <b>48 challenges</b>. Most challenges are about <b>improving your digital experience/home</b>. Some can be done in
    10 minutes, some might take an hour or longer. There's no need to do every single one - though I recommend it! Please note there are only <b>24 doors</b> because that's how it is in my country, we
    celebrate on the 24th. Btw, the doors can only be opened if it's actually that day (in your timezone) or later. This page will stay up after december too, so there's no need for you to note down
    challenges you want to do later.
    <b>Happy Holidays!</b>
