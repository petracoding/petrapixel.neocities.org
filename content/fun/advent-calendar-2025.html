  <h1>Advent Calendar of Digital Challenges!</h1>
  <p>
    I thought it would be fun to create a little advent calendar for all you folks! Every door will have a <b>digital challenge</b> that has something to do with your phone, pc, the internet,
    software, etc. Most challenges are about <b>improving your digital experience/home</b>. Some can be done in 5 minutes, some might take an hour or longer. There's no need to do every single one -
    though I recommend it! No challenges will be specific to having your own website, so you can participate even if you don't have a website!
  </p>
  <p>Real life is keeping me REALLY busy so the calendar might not be pretty, but it will be there!</p>
  <p><i>(Doors can only be opened if it's actually that day or later (in your timezone) - no cheating!)</i></p>
  <!-- <p><b>Happy Holidays!</b></p> -->

  <noscript>JavaScript is required to view the calendar, sorry!</noscript>
