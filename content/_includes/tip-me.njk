          >This autumn I took in a stray <a href="/about/cats">cat</a> that gave birth to 5 kittens in my apartment. <mark>As an unemployed uni student, the expenses have been rough for me.</mark></b
        >
        Currently they eat almost 10 packages of wet food a day, plus dry food, cat litter, and of course the expensive vet appointments. I also will have to get Holly (the mom) spayed, which will
        cost 200 Euros. I already spent over 400 Euros on them since October. I appreciate ANY help, no matter how small!
