        ><b>This autumn I took in a stray <a href="/about/cats">cat</a> that gave birth to 5 kittens in my apartment. As an unemployed uni student, the expenses have been rough for me.</b>
        <small style="display: block; margin-top: 5px">
          Currently I need 10 packages of wet food a day + dry food + cat litter + vet appointments. I also will have to get the mom spayed (200eur). I already spent over 400eur on them since October.
          I appreciate ANY help, no matter how small! Thank you!!!</small
