  <h1>Manifesto</h1>
  <p>After reading some really good (and some <i>really bad</i>) manifestos on other people's websites, I decided to write my own.</p>
  <p>What's the point of this? I don't really know. It's just me rambling about why I have a website, what the point of my website is, and what I think about the indie web community I guess.</p>
  <p>Please note that these are just my opinions based on my experiences. I haven't had a personal website for long, and only really joined Neocities in 2024.</p>
  <!--<p><b>As of February 2025 this manifesto is still work-in-progress and might change/expand a bit.</b></p>-->

  <h4>Nostalgia</h4>
  <p>
    I've read in other manifestos (not naming any names) that the whole nostalgia trip (aka 'old web aesthetic' surrounding most indie websites is bullshit. "The Internet was never truly like that!"
    So what? I didn't grow up with the actual 'old web'. I'm even slightly too young to have had MySpace. I was born in 1999 (during the height of GeoCities' popularity), and the personal websites I
    made as a kid were not coded, but created with easy-to-use website builders like Wix - and there weren't many personal websites. I experienced the dying art of HTML/CSS as a hobby for the masses
    through <a href="https://www.wittyprofiles.com/" target="_blank">WittyProfiles</a> (which, for the uninitiated, is a community for posting quotes and other HTML/CSS snippets in fancy formats).
    Then later in my teens I experienced the wonderful world of hobbyist tumblr theme makers (and even <a href="https://cloudythms.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">made my own</a>). So, that is all to
    say, I didn't grow up with the actual 'old web' (and neither did most people joining the Indie Web today), and I don't care. The point of the indie web revival is not to resurrect the decomposing
    corpse of the late 90s and early 00s. The point is to take the good parts of the 'old web' and carry them into the present, adapting them (if necessary) as we go.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also highly disagree with any kind of statement others make about Neocities websites in general. Phrases like "all look the same" or "uninspired"... Neocities is a website hoster. That's it.
    It's a service provided, and part of this service are some social features like following and a dashboard and profiles, but Neocities <i>is not</i> a homogenous mass of Indie Web sites. You can
    host practically anything (legal) on Neocities. There are no limitations to it. You don't <i>have to</i> be creative on your website. You don't <i>have to</i> do <i>anything</i>, you don't even
    have to use Neocities' social features. Isn't that the whole point? To be free to do whatever <i>you</i> want, no matter what other people's opinions are? For example, I hate autoplay music/sound
    on someone's site. But people do not create their sites for <i>me</i>. If I visit a site that I don't like, I leave. Easy as that. This isn't Twitter, after all.
  </p>
  <p>
    Besides, a lot of people (sometimes including me) say "Neocities sites" when they mean "indie websites" (and with "indie websites" they mean a very specific kind of site), even though it
    absolutely isn't a synonym. Like I said, Neocities isn't homogenous. And on top of that, there are a <i>ton</i> of indie websites that are hosted on other hosters. There isn't even a point in
    listing all these possible hosters because they can even be self-hosted.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, even if it was true that most indie web sites look the same and are uninspired (which I don't personally believe): Does it matter if everyone's having fun? Who decided that websites need to be
    high art? <a href="https://remoji.com/" target="_blank">They don't.</a>. Personally, self-indulgent art has always done more for me than 'beautiful' or 'meaningful' art. (I put those words in
    quotes because I don't actually believe that they are objective terms.) My own website is self-indulgent all the way. And if I come across the 200th indie website that looks like a Windows XP
    desktop then it might not be unique, or even interesting, but it is almost definitely self-indulgent, and that's always a good thing to me.

  <h4>Accessibility</h4>
  <p>
    Of course, there are some basic etiquette "do"s and "don't"s, just like with anything. But very few of these are hard-written rules (e.g. marking your website as 18+ if it is) and at the end
    everyone has to decide for themselves whether they care about other people's experience on their website or not. I saw this the other day when there was a discussion about a Neocities site that
    included a screamer (a scary visual with loud sound intended to scare people who visit the site). There is no rule against that. You know what they say, being an asshole is not illegal. It's just
    being an asshole. I think this whole thing comes up a lot when talking about accessibility.
  </p>
  <p>
    In my experience, there seem to be two factions when it comes to accessibility: the "You have to make your website accessible or you are an ableist douchebag" side, and the "It's my website, I can
    do whatever I want" side. But of course, as always, it's more nuanced than this. Is it important to make your website accessible? Yes, of course. But at the same time, we can't demand from
    beginner coders who only just learned the basics to know the dos-and-donts of web accessibility. (I can say from my professional experience that not even professional web developers are usually
    expected to know more about it than the basics.) While some things (like adding <code>alt</code> tags to images) are easy to do, it's not an easy thing to <i>know</i> that you have to do it. One
    aspect of accessibility it responsiveness (i.e. your website being usable on any screen size), and that's not always easy to do for a beginner. So, in my opinion, putting a bit of effort into it
    goes a long way.
  </p>
  <p>
    By the way, a lot of people think accessibility means making your website more - well - accessible to disabled people. But it's more than that. I'm not disabled, but accessibility helps me too. I
    have a low-quality monitor, so I can't see sites with low contrast colors well. (I literally sometimes can't see the difference between white and light gray.) Other people are perfectly able to
    use a mouse but prefer navigating their device with a keyboard. Most people don't enjoy autoplay sound, as it startles them and is annoying when they're already listening to their own music. And
    too many moving images at once can disorient anyone. Accessibility is just usability in different clothes. Every site needs it at least a little bit. But just like nobody is forcing you to make
    your website easy to use, nobody is forcing you to make your website accessible.
  </p>
  <p>
    Having said all that, I think there's one thing to keep in mind when thinking about usability, and that is design. Unique, interesting designs that go beyond what is normal or expected of websites
    (even old ones) are rarely also very usable. It's a sacrifice some <i>are</i> willing to make. I myself have made usability sacrifices for the sake of aesthetics (for example my main body font,
    which is not the easiest to read) but I've tried to balance it (for example by adding a "toggle font" button). This whole struggle comes from the fact that a website is both a tool and a piece of
    art. For some it's more the former, for others it's more the latter.

  <h4>Social Media</h4>
  <p>
    Like many people who have a personal website these days, I'm sick of social media. I think my breaking point came in 2020-ish when I was using Twitter and TikTok and I hated it.
    <a href="/blog/why-i-stopped-using-social-media">I already talked about</a> why (and how) I stopped using most social media, so I won't go into detail now, but essentially: I think there's good
    ways to use social media, but I also think that most people <i>don't</i> use it in those good ways. Personally, I have my 'social media networks of choice' that I still return to regularly, but
    I've tried to make it a quiet experience. By that I mean, I don't like following a lot of people, or having too many posts on my feed, or checking the trending page, or anything like that. My
    number one rule is: Whenever I visit a social media site, I need a reason. For example, I go to Pinterest to find aesthetic images of the wild west, or I go on Tumblr to reblog gifs of my favorite
    YouTubers.
  </p>
  <p>
    So what does all of that have to do with my website? Well, like many others, my website is a sort of "escape" from social media. Here, I can show off my art without hashtags, I can write reviews
    without waiting for likes, and I can talk about myself in more than the maximum amount of characters allowed in *insert social media here*'s bio. For some, then, it does not make sense that I
    participate in the Neocities social features (like the <a href="https://neocities.org/site/petrapixel" target="_blank">profile</a>), but to me that's something <i>so</i> far removed from
    traditional social media that it's refreshing. Followers and Likes exist, but their existence actually makes sense, and it's generally not a popularity contest.
  </p>
  <p>
    I wouldn't say, however, that the indie web, or creating a personal website, is a 'cure' for social media. It's a neat little corner of the web, but it highly benefits from not being all to
    well-known. (Ask any person on the street whether they've heard of Neocities, and you'll get confused looks.) Just like traditional social media networks that only have a (comparably) small user
    base, the indie web community just seems chill and quiet. For now...

  <p>Some stuff I want to leave you with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Coding a personal website is really fun and rewarding, but it's not something for everyone.</li>
    <li>Joining the indie web community is not going to cure you of that icky feeling you get when using social media.</li>
    <li>Other people's websites aren't made to appeal to <i>you</i> (and they shouldn't be).</li>
    <li>Personal websites are a form of art that is often about self-expression.</li>
    <li>Nostalgia isn't cheap art as long as it is genuine.</li>
