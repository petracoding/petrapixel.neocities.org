    My family got Feli as a kitten when I was 8 years old. We gave her a male name because we thought she was a boy! She grew up with me, and I love her very much, but she can be a bitch sometimes
    (she loves to bite and scratch you!). She doesn't like being picked up anymore, and she's getting a bit old, but except for a bad hip she's still as healthy as ever!
    <img aria-hidden="true" alt="" src="../assets/img/inline/blush.gif" /> Feli hates other cats and is very territorial about our patio (with a little help from my mom). And she meows. A lot.
    <img aria-hidden="true" alt="" src="../assets/img/inline/dead.gif" /> She is trained, and knows the command for sit, give paw, high five, and beg (stand up on hind legs).

    <div class="cat__description">
      Some neighbor's cat that sometimes visits my sister's apartment in the search for snacks. (Fun fact: He showed up 1 minute after I wrote this sentence!! What are the chances??) Sometimes we
      don't see him for months, but he always comes back. We also often see him while jogging around the neighborhood! He's affectionate, but increadibly badly behaved. We named him after Izzy Hands
      from 'Our Flag Means Death', and have no idea what his real name is because we don't know who his owner is. <img aria-hidden="true" alt="" src="../assets/img/inline/laughing.gif" />
